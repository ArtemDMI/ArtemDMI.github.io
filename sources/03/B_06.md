Joke aside there's actually a reason french people can spot so easily english speakers : unlike most other languages, french is monotonous.

Native english speakers are so used to put stress on certain syllables it seems to require a lot of practice to actually pull off a full monotonous sentence.

Edit: as other said, I oversimplified it. French do have tone but relative to the start/end of the sentence or to convey emotions. Read more detailed comments down below for more accuracy

I somehow nailed (maybe at least some) of those mannerisms in high school thanks to obsessively watching French videos on YouTube. My French professor was beaming and gave me straight As for the rest of the school year. 

I then fell out of practice and was never as good at speaking French again 🥲

In term of tone, French and English, as well as most European languages are relatively monotonous and they don't distinguish a lot between tones (contrary to Mandarn for example). However, tone can be used at the sentence scale to convey meta-information (like for example marking the sentence as a question with a rising tone), and in French in particular, the stress pattern does have a slight change of tone on the stressed syllables, which is generally not the case in English.

What I think you were talking about isn't monotonousness, it's isochrony, that's to say all syllables except for the stressed ones have the same length, so they are not unstressed.

English has a lexical stress, where most words have a stressed and unstressed syllables, as a part of the word itself.

French has a syntactic stress where the last syllable of a rhythmic group (roughly a grammatically meaningful group of words) is stressed with an elongation and a sharp change in tone. The first syllable of the group also takes a smaller stress in the form of a change in volume in a way that is similar to English stress.

The stress in French is more regular and not a feature of the words themselves, so rhythm is not the same but in both laguages, actually speaking in a monotonous way is not normal and will be perceived as weird.

But you're right that speakers of stress timed languages like English often tend to struggle with the stress pattern in French and that's an easy way to tell non native speakers.

French also uses emphatic stress (when you say one syllable louder to insist on that word) much less than English, because the preferred method of emphasis is redundancy instead.

That's really interesting. I'd love to hear an example of the same phrase said once the way you just described and again the way a non-native speaker might say it. I'm not even studying French, but I love languages in general, but I'm also fascinated by things like tone, accents, speech impediments, etc.

I realize it's a different country, but I'm Asian and went to Sweden a while ago. I was honestly expecting/hoping everyone would know I was a tourist and speak to me in English without having to awkwardly go "sorry I don't speak Swedish"...but nobody did LOL. Everyone else just apparently assumed I was an immigrant, unless I was doing something very obviously foreign.

Not enough "Euh"s either

The trick to sounding French is to make it seem like it's a struggle to remember every other word you say, like

"Bounjour... euh... ca va? Alors, euh deux euh croissants, s'il vous plait"

Saying "Bonjour" and "ca va" in Paris you are definitely a tourist.

And "ca va" put you immediately in the foreign tourist category as no one would say that to a Bakery clerc they never met before.

It's actually similar in English. Ein paar is like a few (2-5), but people often use couple instead few (it does include 2), so couple has come to cover 3-5 as well, even though it's technically wrong and only mean 2. One exception would be pears, those you can legally only buy as a pair.

I have simply had the opposite experiences in Paris as a tourist. When ordering a morning coffee, or a croissant at a bakery, or some cheese at a market in "French", I've always gotten polite simple replies.
I do not speak French - only a few words or phrases. Obviously the server can hear my accent, but still I get a smile, a one or two word reply in French - and anything more is in English if possible.
I have read many negative comments about France, and Paris in particular, but I love the place and have been very lucky.

Most places in Europe I found are happy when you give their language a go and then will just move to English for expediency, but don't care if you start with English.

The French get their panties in a bunch if you start with English, and will just tolerate you opening in mangled French, but since those are the only two options you just have to push on past the internal eyerolling to ask for a coffee or whatever.

No even the things about Paris are clichés

It’s mostly americans that either have never been to a big city before, or can’t be bothered to learn how to be polite that give us all the bad rap.

A lot of people are surprised that parisians aren’t as rude as they have been told.

My experience of Paris is quite limited, but it did include an old lady literally walking 25 metres across the pavement to deliberately *accidentally walk into* my friend (we're all English) before carrying on her way.

To be fair I'm not sure if it was that we were English, or that we were wearing boiler suits and waders, covered in mud from illegally entering the catacombs and looked like shit that she had the problem with. Either way, it was the most phenomenal display of not-quite passive aggression I'd ever seen.

Politiness is absolutely key in every day French. It does not mean you're nice. But going into a bakery and say "deux croissants" without bonjour / s'il vous plaît would rank you as a an utter psychopath. Like people around would do a double take and look at you in disbelief.

It was the sweatpants. Why not wear pyjamas while you're at it.

Lol. Yeah, like maybe at a bakery with a line out the front door, when a cashier gets to you, you'll be immediately asked what you want and you can skip the "bonjour". You can watch and see what others ahead of you do, if you're not sure in that case.

But in lots of social interactions, if you skip the "Bonjour", as soon as you stop taking, the other person will give you an annoyed look and a "Bonjour" with a tone that lets you know you just fucked up.

Never expected to see Khoi Dao tweets in some random subreddit. Wild. Does that make up yet for him losing his checkmark?

"the only problem with this theory IS THAT IT'S FUCKING WRONG"

anyway.

Everyone coming up with random ways to explain this when ol girl really just has a foreign accent. Think about your native tongue and how easily you can hear the difference even in fluent learners

I'm not trilingual for nothing

If a french person started speaking English to me after I spoke french, I would just stare them dead in the eyes and start speaking Portuguese.

When I first went to France knowing no French and asked them if they spoke English they said no. So I learned some French and now when I visit and try to speak French they all suddenly fucking know English.

No one speaks their language “perfectly” in normal conversation. There are regional slang terms and accents.

One time I pointed at a baguette in a bakery and said "Je voudrais cette baguette-là." (I would like that baguette there) And the baker came back with "Voulez-vous une baguette, ou ce pain-là?" "Do you want a baguette, or do you want that bread right there?"

They've got 10 different things that look just like a baguette but aren't a baguette.
