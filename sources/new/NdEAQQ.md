I had insomnia, so my boyfriend woke up, made me cum, and fell back asleep. And it’s making me think so much about my past abusive relationships
I (31F) got out of an abusive marriage early this year. I didn’t want to get into a new relationship. I planned to have some fun and casually date, and to focus on myself. But I met someone, and I’m so in love.

And not the love-bombing, controlling, manipulative love that I grew up around and then adopted. It is so different. He has similar interests to me. He doesn’t get mad at me for mistakes. He cleans up after himself, and even tells me to stay on the couch while he takes care of things for me. He doesn’t get mad at the pets. He lets me have the last soda. He tells me I’m beautiful, and put my photo as his background on his phone. He opens every door for me, doesn’t yell, doesn’t force sexual things on me, doesn’t threaten. I have mental health issues, but he doesn’t seem to mind. If I’m panicking, he simply holds me and wipes my tears. I could go on and on.

This morning I couldn’t sleep. I woke up at 4AM. He woke up for a moment, and seeing that I was awake, sleepily asked what was wrong. I told him to not worry, and get some rest, he has work today, etc. He fell back asleep. When he woke up again and I was still awake he was cuddling me and said “do you need to cum? Will it help?” Kind of joking, kind of not. I sort of shrugged. But he pulled out a vibrator and silently made me cum. And then he kissed me and fell back asleep. And I finally slept too.

I didn’t know someone so kind, selfless, and sexy like this existed. My ex never cared if I came, and if we were doing anything sexual it always revolved around him. I didn’t even realize a guy could do sexual favors like this. My mom used to tell me that men only wanted sex for themselves and that it wasn’t pleasurable for women. I grew up with that in my brain and always viewed it as a chore, until this relationship. He cares about my needs. Emotionally, and sexually. I can’t even wrap my head around it.

My view of men has been clouded by abuse, from both men in my family and relationships. To have this is so scary and new. This post has no purpose, I’m just thinking, and happy, and frightened. I’m in therapy for all of this, and doing so well in life. I am happy, and hope it continues for a long while.

No expert, continue your therapy. One session at a time and best of luck.

You deserve to be loved, other guy was bad one. Try to embrace the love and not overthink it.

My divorce was finalized a few months ago. I had planned on staying single and enjoying life. A woman I know came back into my life, and being able to show up for her in small ways makes me so damn happy. She appreciates it when I bring her coffee. She appreciates that I'm consistent and calm. She has a 5-year-old autistic son, and I am able to handle his hyperactivity with calm. I work in an ER and I'm in nursing school, so stress is nothing new to me. I've been sober for 8 years. I'm rebuilding my life, and she tells me how proud she is of me for working so hard. Having someone that just likes when I'm around and likes the way I love is so refreshing. I go over and cook food for her and her son. We are both rebuilding and taking things slow. Counseling is helping. Life is hard. Life is short. Enjoy what you can while you can.

Im using the field of dreams approach. I am building a life for myself and the people in my life will show up. I go to class, I go to work, I play disc golf and exercise. I am making sure im a full ass individual that doesnt need anyone to stand tall. If I build it, they will come.

I worked for 10 years doing everything I could to try to make my ex happy, and it just continued to get more abusive and controlling. You will find love, I hope you get out, and don’t EVER give up hope ❤️

The day my wife left me, I knew it was coming. My coping mechanism wasn't anger or drinking. I was home alone all afternoon, so I deep cleaned the house so she could leave me in a clean, tidy house. I got on my hands and knees and scrubbed the floors. There were flowers waiting when she got home. But nothing I did was enough because it wasn't what I did that was the problem; it was that she wasn't attracted to ME. She told me how much I spoiled her and how great of a nurse I was going to be, but that she was done trying to force herself to love me and she really just loved the way I treated her. I'm so thankful for her letting me go because I would have broken myself trying to make it work. I lost my whole family that day. My stepson is 17 and angry at the world already and has pulled away. Her family has been my family for 8+ years. I lost my whole world. But I refuse to be broken. Im not going to stop loving people the way I do just because some people dont want me.

My wife left me, and my first few counseling appointments focused on the guilt I felt for being relieved she left. We didn't work together. We helped each other heal and grow over our relationship, but we grew into different people. We didn't have intimacy; we had separate lives. We didn't scream or fight; we were just indifferent. I hope the best for her but I wasn't it. I deserve to have someone who wants me, not needs me. You deserve happiness and love. We all do.

Yea, I think there is some of that too, but when I think about it she was always controlling. I'm going to counseling tomorrow and I am going to ask the therapist their opinion on it. I never considered this to be abusive and controlling but it was always because I cowtailed to her all of the time.

Like she would get mad at me for having a different opinion. It made no sense to me but I loved her and I'm not a prideful person so I just bit the bullet and did what she wanted all the time.

Now there is no loving kindness, there is only nastiness and manipulation. She tried to manipulate me yesterday when I told her I think we should separate. She cried saying I need help and to go see a therapist. I have been seeing a therapist (another thing she wanted me to do) and they are of the opinion that I'm healthy, if just having a bad time with some family health issues. She's literally trying to gaslight me into thinking I'm insane.

When you hear about these abusive relationships you kinda see the abuser as some Snidely Whiplash mustache twirling type trying to control people. I see now that she doesn't even know she's doing it. I will show her very clear examples of her doing it but it's like there is some filter where she can't see it, like those words don't make it to her brain. It's wild to watch, but in the end I feel for her, she is slowly killing herself trying to control everything in her life

I dealt with similar issues. It was my job to mold to her and I was supposed to accept her as she is. Sometimes separation is the best option

Please do not stay in the loveless awful soul destroying space. The Out of the Fog and Crappy Childhood Fairy sites are good to help you see that the drama they create is designed to keep you hooked and on eggshells trying to twist l8ke a pretzel to please them but they are never going to be capable of loving you back. If you are capable of love that is wonderful and maybe it is time to focus on loving yourself and fillung your own cup. There are plenty of women in the world who could love you back but your abusive partner isn't one of them. Hope you find light love and a fresh start in 2026.

Life is short, but it's also the longest thing you'll ever do. Make sure your kids are taken care of whatever you do, but you don't have to stay with that person if it robs you of so much joy. Also, you're not stupid for trying to please them, you're a partner who brings a lot of love and a desire for self-improvement to the table. Any sane, self-respecting future partner will immediately see what a gem that makes you. Don't quit on your joy - the grass isn't always greener on the other side, but the journey out of this one is often its own reward.

Please take some time each week for yourself, even if it’s just 20 minutes a day. Before work, after work, find a time just for you to breathe. Just feel yourself breathe, deeply and evenly. It will help that physical feeling in your chest. Maybe even the emotions you’re feeling too.

I am this guy and my girlfriend of over 7 years was you. Legit mirrored situations.

Unfortunately I couldn’t fix all her problems and she never went to therapy to address all the trauma she had experienced with her ex…she tried to handle it on her own which led to alcohol dependency and her having to go to rehab a couple times in 2022. During those dark times, she did some terrible things that fundamentally altered the way I feel and see her. Also changed me as a person and not in a positive way.

All that being said, she’s been sober for over 500 days and is probably a better person now than she’s ever been. It feels like a cruel joke bc she’s everything I always wanted now but she can’t take back the wrongs that occurred in ‘22 and it feels like those things will live forever inside me.

Keep getting the help you need even if you feel better than ever being with him. Don’t put him through what you went through. Good luck to you guys!!
