How often are you intimate with your partner?
This question is primarily for those 30 and up who have been in long term marriages/relationships/partnerships.

For context, we’re both nearing 40 and have been together for almost 15 years. I’d say within the last few years we’re both starting to experience the little physical changes that come with age and our lifestyle is changing as well, nothing necessarily bad or good- just different and new. This feels too taboo for me to ask most people I’m close with IRL but I often find myself wondering what’s the “norm” for most people in similar phases of life. I understand that this likely varies from couple to couple and there’s no rule, but I’m curious. Nobody really talks about it and those who do are usually one extreme end of the spectrum or the other.

Edited to add: I never expected this level of engagement but I truly do appreciate everyone’s input. This is one of the things I love most about Reddit compared to other platforms. Receiving feedback from so many other people without the added interpersonal messiness is oddly so helpful and almost feels more genuine when forgoing the typical pleasantries or faux pas. I appreciate the transparency, folks.

This is encouraging, because with two kids under 6 it's been literally driving us insane.

I’ve heard of folks scheduling it. It’s not too different than a date night really, and most folks wouldn’t have pangs about scheduling a date night. Everyone I’ve read about that does that says it actually ramps up excitement like a kink or something.

Wednesdays and Saturdays. It changed our life. We wake up looking forward to our evening together, dress a little nicer, take care of ourselves a bit more closely. We give the kids a simple dinner, then once they’re down, we have a ‘date’ - we have dinner together, a glass of wine or two, a movie, and then we get right to it. There’s no dancing around it. We both know what’s happening, and it makes the whole situation better. Even if we’re tired or conditions are not perfect, we try to go for it. We just remind ourselves that it is always enjoyable, and go for it… knowing what is going to happen allows us to focus on each other a bit more, and believe it or not, scheduling makes it more romantic.

Yea, I hear ya. I guess that is sort of the point, though. Even if we’re exhausted, we go for it. The fatigue generally fades away fairly quickly.

My (M63) and my wife (F62) just talked about scheduling it and both of us joked about the song “Business Time” by Flight of the Concords. “Because it’s Wednesday and Wednesday night is the night we usually make love.” Otherwise it’s just 2-4 times a month, I’d like more, she’d be ok with less.

Can confirm. The only downside is that when scheduled relations get delayed or deferred, we both get cranky AF.

Healthy communication in a relationship is important. A lot of people refuse to talk about it with each other because they feel ashamed of expectations.

Simply saying, "We haven't had sex in over two weeks (month, year, whatever)" can create so much anxiety if there are other, unaddressed, problems, or resentments.

But the fact is, if you can't openly discuss intimacy like mature adults, then that's the first issue to address.

Like, try to have any 15 minute conversation about sex with your partner right now.. if you can go back and forth about what you like or don't like about butt stuff, then you're in a healthy relationship.

And if not, you need to address why they can't open up to you.

When our kids were little my wife would get something on TV to get their interest. Then she’d turn on her motion sensor she bought off Amazon and an alarm sensor at the door between the kitchen and garage. Then she’d ask me to help her fold laundry in the garage and we’d go do it in the minivan. When our twins were in college they put 2 and 2 together and realized what those sensors were really for. Lol they were grossed out.

Total tangent: I'm horrified that you have college-aged kids whose early childhood coincided with Amazon sensors. WE ARE NOT OLD ENOUGH FOR THIS AND NEITHER ARE THEY

(I'm just in denial. Carry on.)

That is really clever! 😂

Also I'm probably weird,  but i'm happy that my parents are in love with each other. Sometimes i do notice signs of action,  but it's fine by me.

My parents would just tell me "mom and dad needs some alone time" then lock the bedroom door. Different times.

Yep. Their bedroom was at the end of the hall and we were taught when the doors closed leave it alone. Unless it was an emergency. But we just played in the living room fine.

We were like 3x a week first decade, 2x a week second decade, 1x a week 3rd decade, 2x a month 4th decade and now as we enter our 5th decade it’s about once a month. But we still connect via long hugs multiple times a day. Hugs are super important to my wife. Took a long time for me to figure that out.

Fun fact: Did you know that while while you may not enjoy them, a 20 seconds hug (singing happy birthday twice) triggers a release of brain chemicals that are miss boosting and also create a stronger emotional/physical bond between two people - even if you’re not doing it because you enjoy it! So you’re both benefiting when you do. And as a wife, thank you for making the effort 🤍

Took me about 20 years but I finally figured out it’s my wife’s super food. It needs to be a long hug where I really pause everything and give her all my attention for a minute.

I wasn't either (woman), but a good solid long hug where you both stop and slow the world down for like 20 seconds is actually the best. It has to be with the right person that does that for you of course and who you feel ultimately comfortable in their arms, though. Idk the older I get the more I appreciate taking those "taking our time" moments where nothing else in the world feels more important for either of us for that brief moment. And it really does connect you in a way that's like, you're the person I want to stop and savor a moment moment with, even after all the time we've been together it's still important. And seeing you do too makes me feel like I matter a lot to that person and feels like they're telling me "I've got you I'm here and I want to be". It kinda feels like a love checkpoint or something lol. All that stuff about it building a bond seems true to me at this point

Yeah I could never understand why men don’t understand how important and needed hugs are. My husband struggles with knowing what to say to others when they are upset……I tell him it’s simple if you don’t know what to say, just give them a hug.

We are in our mid 40s with 4 kids, we average twice a month. Sometimes more sometimes less. When the kids were younger it was less. We even went an entire year after our second was born.

ETA details bc people are being weird

We've been together 23 years, married for 19.

My husband has always been an equal partner in our home and with our children.

Our longest dry spells have almost exclusively been because of my health issues, during which my husband has always supported me and waited patiently. He's never been anything other than kind and respectful about it.

All y'all saying you could never go that long need to let your partners know that if they get ill you will be focused on your nut instead of their health. They deserve to know so they can find better for themselves.
