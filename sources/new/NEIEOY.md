Title: The “Dumb” Character That Isn’t Really Dumb
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT6BOWhFYU4

so recently I've been intrigued with a
common Trope we've seen in sitcoms for
decades and that's the dumb character
Trope you know that one character in a
lot of sitcoms that's just too dumb to
function the character that makes you go
hm how do they even get dressed in the
morning or how do they not fall down
more just ask her how long she's going
to live women live longer than
men how do you not fall down more yeah I
just stole that joke cuz I thought it
was funny but anyways there's lots of
really dumb characters in sitcoms like
Kelo from that 70 show Britney from Glee
Karen from Mean Girls yeah I know Mean
Girls is a movie but Karen's just so
funnily dumb it's 68° and there's a 30%
chance that it's already raining but I'm
more interested in characters that did
not start off being really dumb
characters that might have actually
started off being smart But as time went
on they got progressively more and more
stupid say hello to the new champ of
channelers Dum States game wow how many
you got
56 I found those characters to be more
interesting because you can literally
see them get progressively dumb as time
goes on and I'm just so fascinated by
that change in character but why is that
even a thing why do some characters
start off being relatively normal only
to get increasingly dimwitted and why do
the writers choose to make those changes
to begin with now there's a lot of
different characters that embody this
stroke but in order to do this analysis
I will only be looking at a couple
different characters to start off with
and see how they progressively devolved
and got worse as the length of their
series dragged
[Music]
on Joey was actually the reason I wanted
to make this video in the first place
because in rewatching friends one of the
first things that stood out to me in the
first season was that Joey wasn't brain
dead okay I'm sorry but often with these
dumb characters it isn't just that they
don't know what the capital of Australia
is which of course is Margo Savon it's
that they quite literally have the the
brains of a
six-year-old oh my God I know it's stuck
bordering on some kind of mental illness
like you get the impression they
probably couldn't even count to 20 and
you know I've met my fair share of dumb
people but never quite like the ones we
see on TV and Joey triani perfectly
encapsulates that idea for me but what's
interesting is that he never started off
that way each of the friends have very
defining characteristics that set them
apart from each other and when you watch
the P episode of Friends it becomes
clear that Joy's defining characteristic
is that he's supposed to be this super
New York cool attractive ladies man you
need anything you can always come to
Joey me and Chandler live right across
the hall and he's away a
lot Joey stop hitting on her it's her
wedding day what like there's a rule or
something like that's his thing he was
the cool hot actor guy in the friend
group and that kind of characterization
is very prominent in the first couple
episodes of friends but I want to say by
like episode 4 there's a sh sh in Joy's
character where he gets really dumb and
that continues as the series goes on he
gets more and more dumb what would you
do if you were omnipotent probably kill
myself excuse me hey if Little Joey's
dead then I got no
reason like I think that because the
Joey we get in Season 10 is so vastly
different from the Joey we get in the
beginning of the series and because Joy
is most well known for being the cluest
one among the friend group there's a lot
of people who might not even realize the
character didn't start off that way even
the creators of the show when describing
the character in the beginning of the
series described him as a struggling
actor who gets a lot of girls that was
supposed to be his thing but Joey gets
really dumb as the show goes on and that
kind of became what he was most known
for he's the dumb friend accidentally
proposed to Rachel can I just stop you
right there for a second when people do
this I don't really know what that means
and honestly we do get a lot of funny
moments from Joy because he's so dumb
but I am super interested about why this
change was even made why make him so
dimwitted and why did it have to be that
extreme Joey also at one point tried to
be smarter just so he could keep up with
conversations with his friends I'm
telling you it's totally
unconstitutional totally it
is I think he deserves a Nobel
Prize
no it's kind of sad because Joey often
times feels left out of conversations
among his friend group and he has to
pretend that he has any idea what
they're talking about and he earnestly
does try to become smart just so he can
feel more included among the friend
group and it's actually kind of sad but
I don't understand why they had to make
this change to begin with he was fine in
the first couple of episodes but it was
like they found it easier to make him
funny by having him just not be able to
understand what anybody's talking about
anything else in this production of our
town was simply terrible Joey tribiani
was
abysmal so K's a pretty interesting
character to me because now I think the
most popular version of this character
that is cemented in people's minds is
this version what are you doing here you
said you wanted to work on our project
at your house not here whatever let's
just go in no you can't but what if I
told you that cat used to be smart
question mark So in the palette episode
of Victorious in cat's introduction the
character was this very energetic young
girl that would switch dramatically from
one emotion to the next in a millisecond
my name's cat oh like the animal what's
that supposed to mean
nothing I I love cats me too they're so
cute cat's earliest characterization was
that she was a bit ditzy easily
distracted and would have these drastic
changes in mood seemingly stemming from
her deeply traumatic home life oh my
life's the worst here's a piece of candy
yay I love
candy but as the series went on Kent not
only became increasingly clueless but
there was also this weird
infantilization of the character now it
wasn't just that cat was D um it was
that cat essentially had the brain of a
six-year-old and was incapable of
engaging with her peirs on their
level hey
Cat you're killing me but also that's
compounded by the fact that cat is more
sexualized than the others so she's
simultaneously treated like a child in
the show while also being put in these
really weird circumstances but I'm sure
this wasn't a weird sexually gratifying
fetish for the creator of the show or
anything like I don't think they were
trying to impose their own fantasies
onto this character or anything like
that I mean it's perfectly normal for a
teenage girl to stick her foot in her
mouth yep nothing strange going on here
I actually found that the earliest
depictions of cat were more interesting
because she basically confused everyone
around her constantly again not because
she was stupid but just because of how
overly sensitive and dramatic she was I
take criticism really
well no you don't what's up supposed to
mean just that you don't take criticism
very well why don't you just kick me in
the face but that running gag was
quickly dropped we saw less of these
drastic mood changes and now cat was
confusing everyone around her because
she simply has no idea how the world
Works cat why did you just throw your
drink in the trash cuz I wasn't thirsty
I also just love that canonically in
vict ious cat doesn't have a brain the
butterfly was in your left ear I know
but it came out of your right ear it's a
miracle cat's progression as a character
continues to be more and more incoherent
even into the spin-off series Simon Cat
and honestly cat from semon cat is like
if you took the Victorious version of
cat and drowned her in red hair dye I
know what it's called he wrote that song
for me cat I'm SW me it was cat on
steroids this girl was dumber than a bag
of rocks and you can noticed the changes
in cat's character with how much more
high pitched Ariana's delivery becomes
because this iconic cat voice was not
present in the earlier episodes of the
show but it really
hurts oh lunch yay this was something
that Ariana developed and mastered at
the show went on and by the time we
reach the later seasons of Victorious
cat was hitting whistle tones in her
speaking voice I don't laugh like
that puppies wearing
sunglasses
dang it
hi I'm Cat
Valentine simple things confuse
me with most dumb characters there are
glimmers of Brilliance every now and
again you know those moments where
you're like oh my God I can't believe
this dumb character did something smart
why don't we just do it the way Jade
wrote it for that one night cuz Mrs Lee
is going to be there and she wants it
done her way but what if she's not there
I think cat just said something pretty
smart sorry like the joke itself is that
the dumb character was coherent for 2
minutes and then immediately goes back
to being
[Music]
clueless and Des the opp of London tip
in from the Sweet Life Of Z and Cody is
another really popular dumb character in
fact the character is based on Paris
Hilton who public Persona embodied the
dumbb blonde Trope par was playing a
character and acted more dimwitted than
she actually was because that's what
people responded to with the character
it's mostly kind of this blonde bubbly
kind of Barbie AirHead and in real life
I'm the exact opposite I'm not a dumb on
I'm just very good at pretending to be
one you actually knew what Walmart was
yes I know exactly what Walmart is but
London was modeled of the dumb personal
Paris portrayed in the beginning though
London seemed like a more complex
character than just the dumb rich ays
Persona in fact London kind of acted as
a foil to Maddie who was a very smart
but very poor girl that worked at the
hotel and they would often time play off
each other in the show in London's
earlier depiction she was kind of
dimwitted but you never got the
impression that she was just really
stupid especially in the beginning it
was more so that London was so insulated
by her privilege and wealth that she
simply did not care about school or
pretty much anything that didn't have
anything to do with her socialite
lifestyle when is he going to realize
that education and me just don't mix
education and I hello this isn't about
you and that's exactly why she played so
well off Maddie Maddie was really smart
and took a lot of pride in her intellect
because it was pretty much all she had
she had to get a job her family was
really poor and education was Maddy's
way out of that London didn't have to
worry about that so she just never took
school or education seriously because
she knew she would never have to get a
job in fact there's one episode where we
found out that London has not been to
her private school in forever so she's
sent to Maddie's public school to teach
her a lesson and this contrast between
Maddie and London works really well
because they both learn from each other
London learns to be more grateful and
appreciative of all she has and even
Envy some of what Maddie has because her
father is constantly getting remarried
and never visits her London doesn't
really have a close-nit family your
father sends his apologies something
came up in Argentina and he has to
remain there for the rest of the week
okay so to get
me diamond necklace cool but Maddie does
and she even gets to experience that for
a little bit Maddie also learns from
London the earlier J supposition was
that Maddie was book smart but London
was street smart and could give Maddie
advice on boys and dating and social
life and that they essentially both
helped each other grow he may be book
smart but trust me on this when it comes
to things that truly matter like dating
it's time for the pupil to become the PE
but it only took a couple episodes into
the first season for all of that to
change no longer was it just that London
wasn't book smart she just was not smart
at all favorite composer is Bach where's
he been he's dead so we came back from
the dead I mean this girl doesn't even
know the alphabet let me stop when you
taught me the alphabet but that took 14
years and now I know my abds her name
it's your name oh when you stay at the
London or even how to work a gear shift
with the gear shift you mean the
prle I know people would be mad at me if
I didn't mention this moment and you
know it is a really funny scene it still
holds up and Phil Lewis's delivery here
gets me every time oh I'm sorry why
don't we just relax we'll turn on the
radio would you like am or F I still
think that because London was so
insulated by her wealth and privilege
she never really tried super hard to
better herself academically I mean she
had to repeat high school and join the
twins on the cruise because of how bad
her grades were but I still think that
was a more interesting concept a super
rich arys that just cannot bring herself
to care about anyone or anything because
she never has to worry about money than
just a really dumb girl who makes Max
looks like a genius still I do like
London's progress as a character she
becomes more in tune with the people
around her she cares more and she
develops strong relationships with her
friends including Mosby who has always
been a father figure to her and knowing
all of that when we finally get to the
series finale where London is graduating
high school it makes this moment even
more
impactful and thank you for taking care
of me all these years you are welcome I
am so proud of you for graduating high
school and so proud of the woman that
you've become keep in touch okay don't
worry if got you on speed D I'll call
you if I ever have a problem
okay hello I have a
problem I'm going to miss you
[Music]
Drake Parker had a really drastic
character change from the first season
to the second season in season one of
Drake and Josh Drake acted as a foil to
Josh where Josh was a really studious
rule obeying kid who wasn't really
popular Drake was a very popular
rebellious teen who didn't really care
that much about school let's take the
Doom Buggy Out for a quick spin before
they get back didn't you listen were not
allowed I know that's why I said before
they get back again we see where Drake
isn't stupid at all in fact he makes a
lot of a witty jokes that earlier season
Drake would not even be capable of
making Drake's relationship to education
was more so that he was too cool for
school and didn't follow rules but never
that he was just a really dumb guy you
know he was supposed to be the cool guy
to contrast Josh being a loser he's the
brother that gets all the girls Breaks
the Rules and pushes Josh to be more
confident and Josh pushes Drake to be
more considerate of other people and be
less selfish but something strange
happened the first season of Drake and
Josh has six episodes and the second
season has more than twice as many
episodes but by the time we get to
season 2 Drake has a considerable
character change he still maintains a
lot of the characterization he had in
the early season but his dumb meter gets
dial up to an 11 he wasn't just a cool
rebellious musician who gets a lot of
girls he went full hmbo which for people
who don't know is a male bimbo a guy
who's handsome but is very stupid it
says here they're only available in
South armar
South America like it doesn't get worse
than that I think the change in Drake's
character was more egregious to me than
the others because my whole impression
of who Drake was as a character was that
he was the dumb brother so it was really
surprising watching these six episodes
where this is not essential part of his
character at all Drake is witty he comes
up with good plans they're often
dangerous and don't work out but again
he's supposed to be the Street Smart
just position to Josh's book smart we
never addressed just how stupid we were
so dumb and I got Dumber like sometimes
it was so stupid that I was like
South like I've never read America like
you wouldn't you couldn't live on your
own no no way could I live on my own in
an Institute oh absolutely need to be
monitored I always think it's so
interesting that they decided to go with
this change because it really could have
been a very different version of the
character I think Drake for the most
part is still a really interesting and
funny character even with this strange
but they took so much of the dynamicism
of the character by making him this
dimwitted but often times we would still
get flashes of season one Drake like
there are moments moving forward in the
show where Drake says or does something
that would lead you to believe there's a
lot more going behind those eyes than
they had initially led us to believe
it's as if younger Drake his true self
was buried beneath the surface trapped
begging and clawing his way to freedom
in these brief flashes of profoundness I
often feel sad about the Drake we missed
out on a character that truly could have
been very complex but was sacrificed so
the rice could make one of their silly
jokes but you know I can't even be too
mad because dumb drick did give us this
moment what where's the door
hole goes right there see I drew it with
a magic
marker you were supposed to cut it out
with the power saw dude I'm going to oh
really yes so get the power saw okay I
will I see the problem oh do you if
that's not good TV I don't know what it
[Music]
is so Kevin from the office was a really
interesting character because he started
off being really unassuming in the
beginning in the first season Kevin like
most of the other supporting characters
in the office were just regular people
who either didn't like their job or
didn't care about their job but as the
show went on Kevin took on such a
drastic change from his earlier Seasons
that he became kind of a caricature of
what he once was Kevin worked in the
accounting department but by the later
Seasons you're questioning how someone
this stupid Not only was able to get
this job but even graduate from high
school it was so awesome it will shred
anything it will shred a CD
it will
shred a credit
card it'll shred
oh the show even at one point jokes at
the fact that Kevin's stupidity barded
on mental disability what do you do I do
the numbers oh good for
you do you want an
&em oh no that is so so sweep thank you
though later season Kevin becomes almost
unrecognizable from his first season
self he was actually really smart he was
just a regular guy working a dead end
job just want to lie on the beach and
eat hot
dogs that's all I've ever wanted and
yeah he could be crash and make
inappropriate jokes but never because he
was dumb was more of that he was just a
really Brash guy just my mom's coming in
today
mil thanks Kevin Kevin kind of underwent
a similar change to cat where he became
infantilized the show treated him as a
child someone so incapable of even being
able to take care of themselves he just
became this big dumb guy that was
constantly eating and didn't know what
was happening half of the time but again
we would see flashes of Brilliance in
Kevin too moments where it seems like he
knew more than what he was letting on he
would have these moments where it
actually seemed as if Kevin was smart at
five that's only 20 minutes from now the
pie shop is 13 M away so at 55 M an hour
that just gives us has 5 minutes to
spare so wait when pies are involved you
can suddenly do math in your head to the
point where some online theories have
develops that Kevin is secretly a genius
and is only pretending to be dumb so he
wouldn't have a lot of work to do but I
don't think that's the case even in his
private interviews Kevin doesn't seem to
be aware of what's going on he's just as
dimed in the show as he is in his
interviews there are so many other
characters in sitcoms that fit into this
strob there's Chelsea from that so raven
Patrick from SpongeBob SquarePants Andy
from prox and Recreation even in a sense
Michael from the office but why do these
forms of character degradation happen
well all of these characters fall victim
to flanderization which refers to the
way in which a small aspect of a
character becomes exaggerated to the
point where that's all that that
character is known for or recognized as
the term originated from Ned Flanders a
character in The Simpsons when the
earlier season of the show was shown to
be religious as the series went on that
became all he was known for to a
comically ridiculous degree and we see
that happen with all these characters
Joey can't just be a cool New York actor
that gets a lot of girls the clueless
parts of his Persona has to be dial of
2011 cats wear dramatic mood swings and
inability to pick up on social cues are
replaced with nonsensical babbling
London doesn't just not care about
school because she's super rich she
doesn't understand how words work I also
just think this kind of exaggeration and
making these characters caricatures of
themselves does a huge disservice to
their story lines moments of
vulnerability and earnestness these
characters may have from time to time
are constantly undercut because being
exaggerated to this degree means they
cannot change they cannot grow and
evolve and if they do change it's only
to become even more exaggerated and over
the top and I don't think it was just
having these characters playing to HBO
and bimbo roles I think what happened
was that all of these characters started
off dimwit it and so as the show went on
and there were more and more episodes it
became easier to just lean into that one
aspect of the character until that was
pretty much all they weree for some
characters though it was more drastic
like Drake he wasn't dim with it at all
in season 1 he was just really
rebellious and didn't take School
seriously so Drake from season 2 onwards
was a huge shift for the character for
others it was a bit more of a subtle
degradation like Ken and London they
started off being Dy and DWI it to being
so dumb you have to seriously wonder how
they're even attending High School like
they should still be in kindergarten but
their dumb on liners gets a lot of
programmed laugh
tracks yay
booom so they just keep doing that over
and over again until the character is
only for how dumb they are now often
times there are huge changes in shows
from their pilot episode sitcoms will
write and shoot a pilot episode and Shop
it around and after it gets green lit by
a studio some changes may be made so
it's not uncommon for the pette episode
of a sitcom to feel almost
unrecognizable to the rest of the show
sometimes writers may come up with new
ideas for their shows or sometimes
Studios send notes and demand changes be
made for example the pette episode of
Seinfeld had no female lead there was no
Elaine but the studio felt there needed
to be a leading female character so she
gets introduced in the second episode or
in New Girl the character of coach was
in the pilot episode but the actor left
the series after the pilot was filmed so
in episode two we're introduced to a
brand new character Winston who takes
his place these sorts of things happen
all the time so it's not unusual for a
character to behave differently in the
rest of the series than how they appear
in the pilot episode but in every single
case I mentioned in this video this
isn't just a change from the pette
episode to the second episode this is a
huge change from episodes worth of
establishing a character so it makes a
progressive de Evolution even that more
jarring to witness when you sit down to
watch these shows from beginning to end
planarization happens in different forms
too it's not only the stupidity that
gets exaggerated but as more sitcoms are
being made I really do hope we move away
from this trend it's one thing if a
character started off D to be the
comedic relief of a TV show but I've
always been bothered by this drastic
change in characters where that was
never a huge part of their
characterization to begin with so
anyways those are my thoughts and the
flanderization Trope and the
dumbification of these characters let me
