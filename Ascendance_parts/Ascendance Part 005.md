Ummm... Should I say something like, “Thanks for always taking care of 
me?” No, no, a five-year-old child would never say that. What kind of 
conversations do friendly middle-aged women have with neighborhood 
children?! Someone, help me! 

Carla began easily drawing water from the well and washing her clothes 
without looking at me despite my spinning thoughts. As expected, she used that 
stinky animal soap. 

“Are you feeling well today? It’s rare to see you outside.” 

“I’m getting plants. Ralph and Lutz said they needed them for your birds.” 

“My, you’re doing that for us? Sorry for the trouble.” Carla responded lightly 
enough that it was clear she didn’t feel particularly sorry. 

The band of neighborhood moms, mine included, talked amongst themselves 
without stopping. Their hands never stopped no matter who was talking. It was 
really impressive. 

Seriously though, the soap really did smell bad. I felt sick just resting near it. 

I wonder if it’d get better if I used some smell-blocking herbs? Or maybe the 


smells would combine and make something worse? 

While thinking up a countermeasure to the awful smell, I stood up to escape 
it and began pulling up some nearby plants. I wanted to pull out the thick¬ 
stemmed plants with firm-looking fibers, but I wasn’t strong enough to pull them 
out on my own. 

...I can’t do this with my bare hands. Someone, bring me a sickleee! Of 
course, nobody would bring me a sickle, and my weak arms weren’t going to get 
stronger in a day. 

Okaaay... I give up. I’ll just put all my hopes on Tuuli, Ralph, and Lutz. I 
quickly gave up on pulling plants for my own needs and instead selected those 
with soft-looking leaves and sprouts for the chickens. They were easy enough 
for me to pull despite my weakness. 

“Myne, it’s time to go home.” Mom finished the laundry pretty fast. She 
called for me, holding the tightly-packed tub of laundry. I had only filled up 
about half of the small basket, but Mom had work today, so I couldn’t ask her to 
stay. I went home carrying the tiny basket. 

“Ready? Alright, let’s go.” 

“Okay.” I had been sick ever since becoming Myne, with Mom taking days 
off for me and such, so I didn’t know that when I was healthy, she would send 
me to a neighborhood babysitter for the day. 

Makes sense. Tuuli can’t go to the forest when I’m at home. 

“Myne, be a good girl while I’m at work. She’ll be in your care, Gerda.” 

“Yes yes. Come now, Myne.” Gerda the babysitter was watching over several 
children other than me. Most of them were toddlers who were just old enough to 
walk on their own a little. 

In this city, once a child passed the age of three and grew stronger, they’d go 
with their older siblings to the forest or otherwise be old enough to help around 
the house and be left at home. In other words, my family trusted me so little I 
was the same age as a toddler who couldn’t be left home alone. 

Um, what’s that’s supposed to mean?! As I stood, shocked by my family’s 
lack of faith in me, I saw a young boy pick up a toy off of the floor and start 
putting it in his mouth. Beside him another boy smacked a little girl, making her 
cry. 

“Hey, that’s dirty! You’ll get sick if you put that in your mouth!” 

“My my.” 

“Don’t smack people for no reason. Why would you do that?” 


“Oh dear.” 

Stop with the my mys and oh dears! Do your job, Mrs. Gerda! Despite how I 
was another child being babysat, I was the largest kid around and thus ended up 
taking care of everyone else. 

While putting small children to sleep, I thought about how best to make faux- 
papyrus with the soon-to-be-delivered stems. 

...Honestly, I don’t remember the proper method for making papyrus. I mean, 
it never came up on any tests, so how can you blame me? 

Anyway. I remembered reading that papyrus is surprisingly stiff. It was made 
by placing plant fibers vertically and horizontally together, but you could only 
really write well on one side since the fibers are horizontal on the front and 
vertical on the back. There was a warning that it wasn’t very bendable, either, 
but the book naturally hadn’t mentioned how to actually make papyrus itself. 

The main problem was that, despite having seen pictures of it, I couldn’t 
think of a single way to make papyrus. I got the feeling that the fibers were lined 
up right next to each other, but I couldn’t think of how to get them to stick 
together. Does it need sticky plant starch like washi does? Or maybe there’s 
some special way to put them together. 

I thought back to the history book I had read and tried to wring out any useful 
information I could despite how few important details it contained. For now, I 
figured the best thing to do was take the fibers from the hardest-looking stems 
and try weaving them together in a plaid-like pattern. That should make usable 
paper even without some kind of glue to stick them together. 

As long as I can write letters on it, I’ll be fine. 

“Myne, Tuuli’s here for you.” 

“TUUULIII!” 

Tuuli came to get me that evening after returning from the forest. I’m saved. 
Thank goodness she came to get me. Overjoyed, I clung to her. 

Gerda’s style of babysitting hadn’t been to take care of the kids, but rather to 
leave them on their own unless things got dangerous. If they peed themselves, 
she wiped them with a wet cloth and that was it. The room smelled of waste. It 
was hard for me to bear watching kids get treated like that, especially with my 
Japanese values still intact. 

I can’t believe she’s getting paid for doing this. The worst thing was, no 
matter how much I wanted to help, it was a problem too big for my hands. I 
couldn’t babysit children myself, and Gerda’s style of babysitting may be normal 


for this world. People might end up considering me the weird one if I 
complained too much. 

I had spent all my time waiting desperately for someone to come get me, 
wanting to escape the horrid conditions as soon as possible. 

“Did you get lonely, Myne? I guess it has been a long time since you’ve 
stayed here.” 

“You could go with us to the forest if you were just a lil’ bit stronger.” 

“Hope you can come with us by the time next spring comes, Myne.” 

As Tuuli patted my head and both Lutz and Ralph consoled me, I realized 
that I absolutely did have to get stronger, no matter what. I needed to take it 
seriously. Being this weak was causing me nothing but problems. 

“Oh right, we got those plant stems you wanted.” Ralph grabbed some of the 
stems from his basket and showed me. 

The moment I saw them, everything about Gerda vanished from my mind. 
Books were more important than her, and paper meant books. 

“That’s a lot. Thanks! Um, I gathered some plants for you at the well, too.” I 
puffed out my chest with pride, but for some reason all three of them just patted 
my head. Not only that, but Lutz even said “You did good” with a warm smile 
while looking down at me. 

Um... Just how useless do people think I am? I mean, it’s true that I never do 
anything, and I’m useless almost all of the time, but still. 

Tuuli went and got the tiny basket so we could exchange all our plants for the 
stems they gathered. 

Okay. It’s time to make some faux-papyrus! 


Winter Preparations 

I intended to immediately start making faux-papyrus with the gathered stems, 
but unfortunately, life got in the way. 

“Just where do you think you’re going, Myne? Didn’t I tell you that we were 
starting winter preparations today?” 

Right as I was about to leave to go to the well and get the fibers out of the 
plant stems, Mom grabbed the back of my shirt and stopped me. Apparently, 
snowfall was about to lock us inside and we needed to prepare for the long 
upcoming winter. 

But why do I need to help when I’m so useless? No matter how much I 
scoured Myne’s memories, all I got were memories of her catching colds and 
just lazing around, being useless. 

Basically, to say it again: I was completely useless. The best thing I could do 
was not get sick and end up in bed all day. 

“You’re helping me today, Myne. C’mon.” 

“What about work, Dad?” 

“I have a few days off. We workers gotta take turns staying home from work 
if any of us wanna finish preparing, yeah?” 

Wow... Jobs are nice enough to give time off for winter preparations? I didn’t 
expect to see that kind of working class benefit in this world. Or maybe winter 
preparations are just so rough that they’re impossible without a man around the 
house? 

Either way, it was rare for Dad to be at home and spend a lot of quality time 
with me. As you might expect from his occupation as a soldier, he was more of a 
meathead than anything and generally spent his time with Tuuli, who was 
healthy enough that he could take her places without worrying. 

But now that everyone was home, I had no opportunity to escape, and since 
Dad had specifically requested my help, I had no choice but to give up and obey. 

“...What do we need to do?” 

Dad answered while squatting in front of a window and preparing what 
looked like carpenter tools. “Today we’re gonna check to see if anything needs 
fixing. The shutters will be locked tight during snowstorms, so we need to make 


sure none of the hinges are loose or rusted. While we’re at it, we’ll look for 
holes. Once we’re done with that, we’ll clean the chimney and furnace so we can 
use’m without issue over the winter.” 

Um, Dad... ? What are you expecting from my weak little arms that can’t hold 
anything or even use a screwdriver? I understood what we needed to do, but 
even then, I couldn’t imagine that I would be helpful at all. 

Though maybe if I tried super hard and showed that I could be helpful, my 
family’s faith in me would go up a little. It should be simple to find rusted or 
loose hinges with my modern knowledge. 

“Dad, this hinge and its nails are rusted.” 

“Those will last.” 

Um, I’m pretty sure they’re like on the verge of breaking off? They’re a mess. 

I briefly considered whether or not I should trust Dad. It’d be a big problem if a 
window door meant to block a snowstorm broke during the middle of winter. 

I stood on a chair and tried shaking the window door a little. If nothing 
happened, I could trust Dad, but if it broke, then he should learn to trust me. 
After shaking the door a few times, the hinge loudly snapped into two. 

I nodded to myself since that was what I expected, but Dad paled and stared 
at the shaking door with wide eyes. 

“M-Myne, why’d you do that?!” 

“See? It broke. I told you it wouldn’t last all winter. Now, Dad. Fix it.” I 
pointed at the window door, and Dad, ignoring his mistake in judgement, lifted 
me off the chair while sighing. 

“Myne, go help Effa.” 

“Wha? But I’m helping you, Dad. We need to make sure all the hinges won’t 
break during winter, but you’re ignoring the really bad ones.” I shrugged and 
shook my head. Mom told me to help Dad, and so I would. This was all for the 
sake of making my winter as comfortable as possible. 

“We don’t have the money to fix all of them and at this rate you’ll break all 
of ’m. Go help Effa.” 

...Noooo! Money’s a problem here too?! I, having destroyed the hinge that 
Dad had intended to treasure for a little longer, obediently followed his 
instructions and went to the bedroom where Mom and Tuuli were. 

They were drying our sheets and blankets to make them more usable, moving 
our bed to the wall closest to the furnace to make nights a little warmer, and just 
setting up the room to be more livable in the winter. 

“What’s wrong, Myne?” 


“Dad told me to come help you, Mom...” 

“Really? We’ve just about finished here, so we’re about to start preparing the 
lights. We luckily ended up with extra beeswax this year. We’re also going to use 
beef tallow and fruits to make candles and oil for lamps.” 

That all sounded like a real pain. I had been smelling the nasty scent of 
animal oil wafting from nearby homes for several days and just imagining 
smelling the same stink from my own kitchen made me depressed. 

Tuuli started work on extracting oil from fruits, but since I was too weak to 
wield the hammer well, I had no excuse. I could only watch beside Mom as she 
put beef tallow into our largest pot and set it over the fire. 

...It stinks! So bad! Stay strong, me. Despite the smell being so bad I could 
barely breathe, Mom casually melted the tallow and picked out the drags that 
rose to the surface. Surprisingly, however, that was all she did before starting to 
finish up. 

“Wait, Mom. That’s all? You’re not going to (salt it out)?” 

“Hm? Come again?” 

Oh no. I guess this is obvious, but “(salt it out)” didn’t get translated. 

Mom shot me a little glare that said “Are you complaining about my work?” 
but I swallowed my fear and tried to explain what salting out was in as simple 
terminology as possible. 

“Ummm, you put salt water in and then boil it a bit to get more junk out?” 

“Salt water?” 

“Uh huh. If you leave it for a bit afterwards, the oil will harden on top and 
leave just the salt water on bottom, right? You can pour out the water and then 
just use the pure oil. It’s a bit more work, but the oil will smell better and be 
higher quality.” 

As if reacting to the phrase “higher quality,” Mom began salting the oil out. 

The quality of oil we make here was a matter of life or death for me. After 
all, we’d be using the oil in a closed room. I wouldn’t be able to survive a stinky 
home for an entire winter. Well... I couldn’t tell her exactly what ratio of salt 
water to oil is best, but it should still end up better. 

We went with a pretty arbitrary ratio, but thanks to the salting, the yellowed 
tallow became a pure white. The tallow was then split into parts, some to be used 
for candles and some to be used for soap come spring. The candle part was put 
back into the pot and melted again. 

As an aside, the tiny chunks of meat that came out after filtering the tallow 
were used as a pretty tasty soup base. Yum yum. 


After eating lunch, we got to work making candles. 

“Okay, Tuuli. I want you to start making candles now. Gunther and I need to 
prepare the firewood.” 

“Okaaay.” 

Wait... What’s my job? All three of them started their own jobs, so after a 
moment’s thought, I followed Mom out of the front door. Maybe “go help your 
mother” included this. 

But after noticing me, Mom told me to go back inside. “Myne, help Tuuli 
make candles. Be sure not to get in the way.” 

“...Okay.” Sheesh, why do they trust me so little? 

I returned to the kitchen and saw Tuuli cutting strings into identical lengths 
and hanging several of them at a time from little sticks. She then took a stick and 
held it such that the strings dipped into the pot of melted tallow before lifting it 
up and down. Over time, the oil sticking to the string hardened, fattened, and 
began looking like a candle. 

“Wow, so that’s how you make candles.” 

“Don’t just watch, Myne! Help!” 

Tuuli was mad, so in order to help, I grabbed some smell-blocking herbs and 
stuck them to some of the hardening candles. If these worked, I would put more 
herbs into all of them. 

“Myne! Don’t play around!” 

“Just these, okay? Don’t you want candles that don’t stink too, Tuuli? 

Please.” 

“Definitely just these, understand?” Tuuli drove that home, so I gave a big 
nod. 

I didn’t know whether it would work or not, so I had no intention of messing 
with all of them. I put different herbs into each candle so I would be able to see 
which worked the best. 

While Tuuli and I made candles, our parents were preparing firewood. 
Without it we would undoubtedly freeze to death, so making sure we had enough 
ready was absolutely vital. Dad took both the wood Tuuli had picked plus extra 
wood we bought and used an axe to chop it all into fifty-centimeter-long sticks. 
Mom then took the cut firewood and brought it to the winter storeroom. 

“Where are you going, Mom?” I was so surprised to see Mom going into a 
room I didn’t know about that I followed after her. It was news to me, but there 
was another room inside our normal storage room. Apparently it was generally 
only used for winter preparations. About half of the room was already packed 


with tons of wood. 

“Wha? I didn’t know about this room.” 

“It’s our winter storeroom, remember? How could you even forget that, 
Myne?” 

Speaking of which, I had been wondering where Tuuli put all the wood she 
came back with. Now I knew. Since the wood we normally use was put in the 
general storage room, I never noticed there was another one deeper inside. 

“...It’s cold here.” 

“Of course it is. This room is the furthest from the hearth.” 

Our home didn’t have anything fancy like a fireplace, so the hearth slash 
makeshift oven in the kitchen was the only source of heat in the entire house. We 
would generally spend all of our time there. 

And now, our beds were pressed against the singular wall separating them 
from the hearth. As long as fire was burning inside, which was when we children 
went to bed, it was surprisingly warm. 

But it was only warm at the start. Mom would put out the fire before bed, so 
the room was ice cold in the morning. On the other hand, this winter storeroom 
was the furthest room in the house from the hearth, so it was super cold. 

It was the perfect place to put preserved food, oil, and other things we needed 
for the winter. In other words, it was a natural fridge and we didn’t want it 
getting warm. 

“There’s lots of firewood here.” 

“It’s still barely enough, you know.” 

Even though half the room’s full?! I looked at all the firewood stacked in the 
winter storeroom and the word “deforestation” passed through my mind. If a 
single family burned this much wood, how much wood was the entire city using? 

“Myne, don’t start daydreaming, it’s time to prepare for our winter 
handiwork.” 

“I’m not daydreaming!” I protested, but Mom was already heading to the 
kitchen. I hurriedly chased after her. I didn’t want to be left alone in a dark room 
with no windows. 

“Mom, what do you mean by handiwork?” 

“Well. Men fix the tools they use at work, I suppose? If we intend to make 
new tools or furniture, we need to gather the materials ahead of time.” 

“So it’s like work we do over the winter while stuck inside?” 

Mom nodded while counting how many spools of thread we had. “That’s 
right. It’s important that we women make clothes, remember? We won’t be able 


to do that without preparing thread and dyeing cloth ahead of time. I’ve already 
finished all that since I work as a dyer, but we still need to prepare the wool and 
plants like nillen that we’ll be weaving next year.” 

“Huh.” 

“Not to mention, Tuuli’s baptism is next summer. I need to prepare her 
special dress during the winter.” Mom looked around with a deadly serious 
expression, making sure she had everything she needed. 

I got the feeling that I would just get in the way no matter what, so I slid back 
over to where Tuuli was. “What’s your winter handiwork going to be, Tuuli?” 

“I’m gonna make baskets. We’ll sell them when spring comes.” Tuuli was 
preparing her basket-making materials which would serve as her handiwork. She 
was taking some of the wood she gathered in the forest to the well and peeling 
off its bark. She would then run her knife along the fibers to split the wood apart. 

“What’ll you be doing, Myne?” 

“I’m making (faux-papyrus)!” 

“What’s that?” 

“Eheheh. It’s, a, secret.” 

I followed Tuuli’s example and started preparing the fibers I needed for my 
winter handiwork: making faux-papyrus. This was an important job for me. A 
respectable job that nobody would get mad at me for doing. 

To get the fibers out, I basically just had to do what Tuuli was doing, 
probably. Peel off the outer layer of the stems, soak them in water, then dry 
them. Winter preparations began before Tuuli and the others could get too many 
stems, so I decided to just take them all apart for fibers. 

“Tuuli, I want some water too.” 

“...Okay.” 

“Tuuli, how do you think I should get just the fibers out of these stems?” 

“Wha? Umm...” 

“Tuuli, they won’t get blown away if I dry them in the window, right?” 

« 55 

I bundled up the completed fibers. There weren’t many of them, but there 
were probably enough to make one or two sheets of faux-papyrus. With that, my 
own winter preparations were more or less finished. 

Whew. I worked really hard here. Wait, what? Is it just me or does Tuuli look 
annoyed ? 


Stone Slate Get! 


The most important thing to prepare for winter was food. Unlike Japan, there 
weren’t supermarkets open every day of every year. Barely any crops could be 
grown or harvested and the market would barely open due to the weather. If you 
didn’t want to starve to death, you had to prepare ahead of time. Which is why I 
was currently sitting inside the back of a covered wagon between the loads of 
stuff packed into it. 

It all started when Dad woke us all up at the crack of dawn. “Alright, we’re 
going to the farm today! Everyone ready?”
