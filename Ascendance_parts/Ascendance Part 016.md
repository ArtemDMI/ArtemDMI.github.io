“...Okay.” After giving a quiet reply, I was consumed by an intense fever as I 
gripped the last remaining piece of bamboo in my hand. 

The rage of having my belongings burned. 

The frustration of my anger not being understood at all. 

The despair of repeatedly failing to obtain a book despite my best efforts. 

I threw my all at the world and got nothing in return. A sense of 
powerlessness spread through me. I didn’t feel like doing anything. I didn’t even 
care enough to fight the fever inside of me. At this point, I didn’t even feel mad 
at Mom for burning my mokkan and then the bamboo Lutz brought me. 

If only my body had been healthy and strong like an adult’s. If I were all 
grown up, I could have ignored papyrus, clay tablets, and mokkan to just make 
washi right away. If I at least were as healthy as Lutz and had the strength to do a 
fair bit of physical labor, I could have given paper making my best shot. But my 
weak, sickly child’s hands couldn’t even cut down the wood I needed to make 
paper. I couldn’t draw the water I needed, nor could I start fires. 

Maybe all my problems would go away if I waited until I was an adult. But 
that was just far too long to wait. And would I even grow like a normal person? 
Would I get bigger and stronger...? Doubtful. 

If nothing I did mattered, why not just let the raging fever inside of my body 
take over? What’s the point in living in a filthy, uncomfortable world if all my 
best efforts and all my endurance wouldn’t get me books? It’d be better to just 
disappear. 

The second that thought crossed my mind, the heat inside my body energized 
as if to swallow me whole. I stopped thinking about anything and encouraged the 
fever to spread so that I might disappear. 

I only had one regret: I hadn’t apologized to Lutz. He worked so hard to 
prepare those bamboo shoots for me, and I hadn’t apologized for how they had 
ended up getting burned. What Lutz said to me before leaving to get the bamboo 
flashed through my mind. 

“Th-This is just so you can introduce me to Mr. Otto, alright? I’ve already 
done my part, so I’ll be pissed if you don’t get better! Alright?” 

I hadn’t kept my promise to him. He helped me so much and I promised to 
help him in return. Should I really let myself give up and run away into this 


fever? Lutz was right. He already did his part. Letting myself disappear into the 
fever would be simple, but before that, I needed to get better and fulfill my 
promise to Lutz by introducing him to Otto. 

Repeating to myself that this was for Lutz’s sake, I pushed the heat back 
down. I could let the fever consume me after I had fulfilled my promise to Lutz. 
Settling matters before death was important. Last time I died so suddenly, I 
didn’t have the time to do anything. 

...Yeah, exactly. I was totally not ready to die in that earthquake... Aaaaah! 
What even happened after that?! It’s so embarrassing! I have to know, I have to! 
Aaaah! I can ’t die yet! 

All the embarrassing memories of my past life drifted up one by one, and 
after enough shouting that I couldn’t let myself die yet, the fever within my body 
somehow got a lot smaller. 


The Road to a Meeting 


Two days had passed since I pushed thoughts of my dark past into the corner 
of my mind and swore never to think about them again. Dad finally gave me 
permission to go outside again, barring that I did not go further than the gate, 
which meant I could see Otto again. 

“I’m sorry, Mr. Otto. You went out of your way to set up a meeting for me, 
but I just got sick...” Indeed. Otto’s day off passed while I was bedridden with a 
fever, so I missed the opportunity to introduce Lutz to him. 

“I heard from the captain that your fever didn’t go down for five whole days. 
Are you feeling better?” 

“Uh huh, thanks to you.” I smiled, but Otto just furrowed his brows and gave 
me a hard look. 

“Are you really feeling better? You don’t look so good.” 

I didn’t look good, but not because of the fever. It was because I couldn’t 
make paper no matter how hard I tried. “I have a problem that I’m having 
trouble solving. Would you mind telling me what you would do if you were in 
my situation?” 

“Wha? You don’t mind telling me your problem?” Otto opened his eyes wide 
and peered toward me. 

I nodded hard. He had surely experienced things I could never imagine as a 
traveling merchant, and it was more than possible that he could think up a 
solution I couldn’t. “I don’t mind. There’s something I want right away, but I 
don’t have the strength or stamina to make it by myself. I could maybe make it 
by myself after growing up, but I don’t know if my body will be healthy enough 
to grow like a normal person’s. I might not even be alive for much longer. What 
would you do if you were me, Mr. Otto?” 

Otto, who had been nodding as he listened, immediately replied with raised 
eyebrows. “If you can’t do it yourself, just hire someone who can. Is that all 
you’re worried about?” 

“Wha?!” The scales fell from my eyes. I hadn’t even considered hiring 
someone else to get what I want for me. That was just the kind of insight I 
expected from a former merchant. I could easily imagine others hiring me to do 


things, but I had never even considered hiring someone else to do things for me. 

“...I think that’s a really good idea, but I couldn’t afford that.” 

“Yeah, you’re a bit too young for that. Well. If I were you, I’d find someone 
capable and guide them into doing whatever it is you want out of their own 
volition. That’s no easy feat, but it’s no sweat off your back if they willingly do 
it for free.” 

Yup... there’s a former merchant for you. His warm smile belied his 
wonderfully dark ideas. He’s definitely “guiding me” into doing what he wants 
already. I remember him saying that paying a mathematically skilled assistant in 
slate pens is nice for his budget. 

“...I’ll keep that in mind.” Find someone who would do the work for me, get 
involved with them, and make them do it of their own volition. That would be 
pretty hard for me. But I could worry about that later. 

Otto patted me on the shoulder and held out a slate. Talking time was over. 
This was his way of silently saying “Let’s start studying.” 

“Oh, right. Now that you’re healthy again, could you tell that kid that we can 
meet up the day after tomorrow? We can go to, let’s see... The central plaza. 

How does the central plaza at third bell sound?” 

“You mean Lutz. I was just about to ask you about that myself. Thank you.” I 
didn’t think I would forget, but nonetheless I wrote “central plaza, third bell.” 

I looked up and saw that Otto was grinning while rubbing his chin. His smile 
made a shudder of danger run down my spine for some reason, so I instinctively 
straightened up and looked back at him. 

“Yep. I’m betting any kid you wanna introduce me to will be real interesting. 
I’m looking forward to a fun meeting.” 

Well... I think I can interpret that as him saying “Don’t introduce me to 
someone boring. I’m spending my precious day off on this, y’know.” Um... Otto? 
Isn’t this just going to be a casual meeting where you talk about what it’s like to 
be a traveling merchant? I swallowed my inner panic and nodded with a smile 
before dropping my gaze back to the slate. 

I burst into a cold sweat. Oh no. The meeting was so soon but I didn’t 
understand what this “meeting” really meant. And it was too late for me to say 
that, considering I was the one who started it all to introduce Lutz. I desperately 
tried to piece together the implicit meaning of the meeting while scribbling away 
on my slate. 


“Myne, we’re going home.” 


It was a bit early to go home, but Dad came calling for me, so I got my stuff 
together and left the room. 

“Hey, Dad. I told Mr. Otto I wanted to introduce Lutz to him. Do 
introductions like that have any special meaning?” 

“Given his age, I’m guessing he’s looking for apprentice work? I figured he 
was gonna follow the family line of work, is he hoping to be a merchant 
instead?” 

...Looking for work?! No no no, this isn’t anything that serious! I mean, we’re 
just kids, come on. 

“We’re going to meet up so Otto can tell him what it’s like to be a traveling 
merchant.” 

“Yeah, that’s definitely gonna be interpreted as him hoping Otto can 
introduce him to some apprentice work. Though any friend of yours is gonna 
have a hard time with that, Myne.” 

“Why’s that?” 

“Think about it. Taking on an apprentice means looking after them for the 
rest of their lives. Even if they split and go independent, there’s still gonna be a 
connection between’m they can’t cut.” 

Things were more serious than I had anticipated. It wasn’t just a meet up for 
chatting; it was Lutz wanting the former traveling merchant Otto to introduce 
him to someone that would take him on as an apprentice merchant. 

...Aah, which means tomorrow’s meeting will be like a job interview, right?! I 
can’t believe I was setting up something so serious! 

The day after I got home and realized just how serious the situation was 
thanks to Mom and Dad explaining the details about apprentice work, I went to 
the forest with a fully loaded basket. On the way there I apologized to Lutz about 
how the bamboo he gave me had been mistaken for banhit wood and told him 
that the meeting was set for tomorrow. 

When he heard about the bamboo, he sighed and said, “Banhit, huh? Those 
get mixed up a lot, yeah.” When he heard about the meeting, he said, “Thanks, 
Myne,” and looked pretty happy. 

Everyone split up to do their gathering once we reached the forest. I took 
Lutz’s hand and headed to the river. “Okay, Lutz. This is the perfect spot. Let’s 
get you clean.” 

“Wha?” 

Otto took pretty good care of his personal hygiene, perhaps due to his 


background as a merchant. Reason being, he understood how much first 
impressions mattered. And I knew from seeing Otto’s calculating nature at work 
that we didn’t want to go to the meeting unprepared. If he decided after the first 
meeting that Lutz wasn’t worth the effort, he wouldn’t have introduced him to 
even a normal merchant, much less a traveling merchant. 

“The first impression you give someone when meeting them is really 
important. Especially if you’ve been given an opportunity to prepare ahead of 
time. I don’t want him to look down on you just because of your appearance.” 

“I don’t think a wash will change that much, really.” 

The ideal would be to borrow the clothes Ralph wore at his baptism, but I 
didn’t know if he would be willing to lend them. Neither I nor Lutz had any 
special clothing and would thus need to go wearing our normal outfits, but I 
wanted to dress things up where I could. 

Thus, while explaining to Lutz about the effects one’s appearance have on 
others, I washed his hair with my simple all-in-one shampoo. I had brought rags, 
a comb, and a bucket with me to really clean him up until he shined. I put river 
water and shampoo into the bucket before washing his hair over and over just 
like I normally washed Tuuli’s hair. Of course, I wouldn’t stop there. I fully 
intended to wash his entire body. 

“Hey, Lutz. I can think of you wanting to talk to Mr. Otto as you wanting to 
become a traveling merchant, right? You want an introduction so you can 
become a traveling merchant’s apprentice?” I talked to Lutz while washing his 
hair, feeling kind of like a hairdresser talking to a client. 

“Eh? Yeah.” 

The more I wiped Lutz’s hair with a rag, the more his golden blonde hair 
gleamed. It was such a pretty yellow color that I wanted to trade hair with him. I 
combed it to increase its luster and, feeling a little bit jealous, continued my 
questioning. “So, what do you want to do after becoming a traveling merchant? 
Do you just want to travel the world?” 

“Where’s all this coming from?” 

“You really need to think this through.” 

“Why?” 

“Mr. Otto doesn’t know anything about you, Lutz. He’s not like a parent or 
family member who’s known you their whole lives. You need to really think 
about this if you want him to introduce you to someone.” 

According to what I heard from my parents yesterday, the kids of this city 
almost universally began apprentice work with an introduction from their parents 


or a family member. Due to that, they generally followed their parents into a 
similar profession. For example, Tuuli became an apprentice seamstress after 
Mom, who works as a dyer, introduced her to a friend’s workplace. 

Apparently it was rare for kids to go to the same workplace as their parents, 
in order to prevent nepotism. But kids still worked in similar jobs near their 
parents, both so parents will worry less and so that the kids will take their jobs 
more seriously. It was very rare for someone to get an introduction from 
someone outside of the family due to wanting a job their parents would certainly 
reject, like Lutz was doing. 

“Mr. Otto’s meeting you this time as a courtesy, but he’s not that forgiving. 
He’s a former merchant and as calculating as you would expect. If you haven’t 
put enough thought into this, he won’t waste his time meeting you a second 
time.” 

The meeting tomorrow would be like a job interview. If you don’t clean 
yourself up and prepare a good reason for why you want to get hired, it was very 
possible that the interviewer wouldn’t even consider you for the position. 

“...What about you, Myne?” 

“Wha?” 

“Could you give an answer right away if I asked what you would do as a 
merchant?” Lutz, pouting a bit in frustration over not being able to think up an 
answer on the spot, glared at me with his jade eyes. I nodded and responded 
immediately. 

“Uh huh. I want to sell paper. If I were a merchant apprentice, I’d teach 
someone how to make paper and have them make it for me.” 

I wanted books for myself. If possible, I didn’t want to involve other people 
and instead make a book on my own using the tools and materials available to 
me. But I was at my limit. Everything I did ended in failure. At this point I just 
wanted to give my knowledge to someone and have them do everything for me, 
from start to finish. I was sure someone would be willing if I handed over the 
ownership rights in return for an information fee. 

“Paper? Not books?” 

“I need paper to make books. And here, nobody but me wants books, really.” 

“I guess if you’re the only one who wants them, nobody’s gonna buy them, 
huh?” muttered Lutz, exasperated. 

I nodded with a smile. “Uh huh. I don’t think books will sell that easily. But 
paper made from plants will be cheaper to produce than parchment, so I think 
it’ll sell just fine. I’m sure there’s a profit-sawy merchant out there who will see 


the value in my knowledge and pick me up.” 

“...Huh. Guess you did think this through, Myne. I’ll give it a shot too.” 

“I think ‘a friend of Otto’s assistant’ is a weak enough connection that most 
people will reject it. But if you make your intentions clear and show that you can 
bring value to them, I think a merchant would be willing to take care of you 
too.” 

As Lutz glared at the water’s surface and fell deep into thought, I urged him 
forward and made him clean himself. Lutz... This will take too long if you don’t 
wash while thinking. 

Lutz asked Ralph if he could borrow his special outfit, but got rejected for 
fear of it getting dirty, apparently. Therefore, he and I were walking to the central 
plaza in our normal clothes, though he was a lot more clean than usual. 

“Hey, isn’t the meet up at third bell? We’re super early.” 

“That’s the idea. If we get there after them, we’re done for. You really want to 
get there first. Time will fly by if we sit down and talk.” 

In this city, time was told by the temple’s bell ringing once every two, three- 
ish hours. Being late wouldn’t be as big of a deal in this city without clocks, but 
emotionally speaking, I didn’t want us to arrive last; we were already in a 
weaker position. 

“Y’know, my mom asked what was up with my hair last night. It took forever 
to get her off my back.” Lutz pulled on his now-glossy hair with a pitiful look on 
his face. I understood Karla’s feelings. I’d get curious too if my son’s hair got 
silky smooth without warning. 

“Girls really do care about beauty and stuff.” 

“I went ahead and told her you did it for me. 'Go and ask Myne this stuff,’ I 
said.” 

“Bwuh?!” The thought of getting pinned down for questioning by Karla, the 
kind of mother with a loud voice, forceful personality, and stubborn nature made 
my head hurt. “I’ll teach you guys how to make it on your own, so don’t ask for 
mine. I don’t have much myself.” 

“...Oh, my bad. I made you waste some of your stuff on me.” 

“It’s okay. I owe a lot to you, Lutz.” I didn’t mind giving Lutz some shampoo 
considering how much he had been helping me. But resources were limited and 
Tuuli worked hard to make it, so I would rather not give Karla any. As it stood I 
was already having to suffer with washing my hair only once per five days, with 
just water to tide me over in the interim. 


“But y’know...” 

“If it bothers you that much, you can make some extra for me. I’m so weak 
it’s hard for me to squeeze out the oil.” 

“Oh, that’s your problem?” 

We talked to each other for a bit and eventually Otto walked into the central 
plaza. He stood at the entrance, looking around, and upon seeing us grinned 
widely enough that I could see it despite being so far away. 

Aaah... He was definitely testing us. I’ve been careful ever since he gave me 
that dangerous-looking smile and that was definitely the right call. He was 
definitely testing to see if we would come before the bell rang. 

Otto smirked, looking impressed, and waved his hand in another direction, 
whereupon a different man appeared and started walking this way with Otto. I 
felt a cold sweat run down my back. Instinctively, I grabbed Lutz’s hand. He was 
beside me. 

“He’s here, Lutz. Remember to be polite.” 

“R-Right.” 

I could tell from the way they were casually chatting that the other man was 
Otto’s merchant friend. And when that friend looked in our direction, his eyes 
gleamed sharply, like a predator sizing up its prey. 

...Um, I thought this would be an interview between Otto and us! I didn’t hear 
anything about a third person! Ngggh, this is Lutz’s interview, but I’m the one 
getting nervous now! 


Meeting with the Merchant 


I had been right to clean Lutz against his will and teach him about how 
interviews worked. Otto and his friend were both well-dressed and groomed, 
significantly more so than the majority of people passing through the plaza. 

I really wish Lutz had managed to get Ralph ’s good outfit. Their clothes look 
kinda weird... Or rather, I just wasn’t used to the style. They used a lot of cloth 
that formed large drapes, and I couldn’t find any stains or parts traced of 
patchwork, a stark difference from the clothes I was used to seeing. Judging 
from his clothes alone, I could assume that Otto’s friend was making decent 
money. His clothes, posture, and sharp look were all leagues above the 
merchants I saw in the market. 

But although he was a successful merchant, he wasn’t like a wizened 
company president. He had the intensity of a CEO running a venture capital 
firm. At a glance, his curly, milk tea hair gave him a soft impression, but his 
reddish brown eyes were brimming with confidence and gleaming with the sharp 
ferocity of a carnivore. 

“Heya, Myne. I’m guessing that’s Lutz?” 

“Good morning, Otto. This is Lutz, my friend. Thank you for making the 
time to meet us today.” I didn’t know what greeting would work here, so I just 
did my normal chest-tap salute. Otto saluted in return, so that couldn’t have been 
too wrong. 

“Hi, I’m Lutz. It’s nice to meet you.” Lutz looked nervous, but didn’t 
crumble beneath the two adults’ intense looks. He managed to finish the greeting 
I had taught him without stumbling or letting his voice shake. Challenge one, 
complete. 

“Benno, this is Myne, my assistant and the daughter of my captain. Myne, 
this is Benno. An associate from my days as a traveling merchant.” 

“Nice to meet you, I’m Myne.” It wasn’t customary to bow one’s head in this 
world, so I made sure to keep mine up while greeting him with a smile. 

“How polite. I am Benno. It’s pleasure to meet you as well. Hm... You’re a 
pretty well-mannered little girl, huh.” 

“She’s not as young as she looks. She’s six.” Otto followed up on my age for 


Benno, since I probably looked like a four-year-old. Benno opened his eyes 
wide, looked at Otto with amusement, then curved his lips into a grin. 

“...Your assistant hasn’t even been baptized?” 

“Aah, well, actually. I’m in the middle of teaching her to read and write so 
she can become my assistant.” 

“You sure made it sound like she was already helping you out quite a bit.” 

“...Let it go, man.” 

The subtext of their conversation made a chill run down my spine. Would 
Lutz and I be able to hold an interview that these two would accept? For some 
reason... I got the feeling that neither of them would show any mercy to us, even 
though we were pre-baptism kids. 

Benno looked at me from above, suspiciously, and began to talk. “There’s 
something I’m real curious about. Mind if I start with a question?” 

“Not at all. What is it?” 

“What’s that stick stuck in your head?” 

Hm... I see. You’re asking that now because it’d be awkward to bring up 
casual stuff after rejecting us, aren’t you? The interview hasn’t even begun and 
you’re already on the verge of rejecting us? 

With a fake smile plastered on my face, I pulled the hair stick out of my hair 
and held it up to Benno while keeping my eyes locked on him to try and glean 
any information I could from his reaction. “This is a (hair stick). It’s used to 
keep hair bundled up.” 

Otto seemed to have been curious about it as well, given by how he and 
Benno both curiously examined it. They lifted it up, turned it around, and stared 
hard at it. Um... It’s just a stick. There’s no tricks or anything. 

“Looks like a simple stick.” 

“Uh huh. It’s a wood stick my Dad carved out of a branch for me.” 

“You can bundle your hair with just this?” 

“Yes.” He gave back the hair stick and I bundled my hair into its usual style. I 
scooped up some of my hair, wrapped it around the stick, rotated it, and then 
pushed it forward to lock it into place. I did so every day, so I was used to it. 

“Oh hoh... Impressive.” It was the first time either of them had seen me do 
my hair, so both Lutz and Otto looked at it with wide eyes. 

Benno suddenly reached out and touched my hair, then furrowed his brows. 
“Hey. Your hair’s pretty impressive too. What the heck are you putting on it?” 
Unlike his fingers, which were gently touching my hair as if apprising its value, 
his gaze was so sharp I nearly gasped in surprise.
