Um... I didn’t eat the fruit itself, though. Maybe that’s just the only way he 
can understand? I put a hand on my chin and thought about Lutz’s harsh 
rejection. “You have enough bird feed now, right? Then the best thing is for we 
humans to eat it.” 

“Like I’m saying, the leftovers are so dry nobody would eat them!” 

“They only get so dry because people squeeze as much oil as possible out of 
them. If you put a little work in, they’re fine to eat.” 

“Myne, y’know...” Lutz showed no sign of changing his mind no matter what 
I said. 

I’d need to use a little force like I did with Tuuli to change his mind. He 
would definitely understand after eating them. I clenched my fist with resolve, 
ready to execute my plan, when all of a sudden Tuuli weakly hung her head and 
spoke. 

“Um, Lutz. I know it’s hard to believe, but they really are edible. It, um... It 
tasted so good it kind of shocked me.” 

“Wait, seriously? She made you eat bird food, Tuuli?!” Lutz looked at Tuuli 
with eyes full of sympathy. 

“That’s rude, she said it tasted good. I think you just need to taste it for 
yourself. Do you have any fruit juice left over, Lutz?” 

I walked into Lutz’s house and put some of our leftovers into a nearby bowl. I 
then mixed it with about two teaspoons worth of Lutz’s share of the fruit juice. 
After a brief taste test, I nodded to myself. It did indeed taste good. 


“Open wide, Lutz.” 

Likely due to having seen me eat some, Lutz timidly opened his mouth. I 
placed the juice-mixed leftovers into his mouth. He closed his mouth, chewed a 
bit, then opened his eyes wide in surprise. 

“See? Sweet and tasty, isn’t it?” I puffed out my chest with pride, “eheh”-ing 
to myself, when all of a sudden Lutz’s older brothers stopped just watching 
suspiciously from afar and instead swarmed down upon us. 

“Sweet?” 

“Tasty?” 

“Seriously? Lemme try some, Lutz.” 

His older brothers all jammed their fingers into his small bowl. No matter 
how hard Lutz tried to hide the bowl or run away, they were just too much bigger 
than him. Not only could he not run away, he couldn’t even dodge them. 

“Hey, let go! Don’t pick me up! What kinda older brother would steal his 
little brother’s stuff?!” 

“Your stuff is my stuff.” 

“Share your tasty food with everyone, Lutz.” 

“Alright! I got it!” 

Lutz’s resistance was futile. His three older brothers held him down and stole 
the whole bowl. They all jammed their fingers in, and in moments, it was empty. 
If his every meal ended up like this, I could understand why Lutz would 
complain. 

“Aaaaah! Myparue!” 

“Tasty. Is this really bird food?” 

Lutz’s older brothers completely ignored his cries and looked at me, eyes 
opened wide in surprise just like Lutz’s were. This might be my chance. 

“I could make something even better here.” 

“For real?!” 

They all took the bait. Despite how disgusted they had all looked at the idea 
of eating bird food, they were now on hands and feet asking for more, likely due 
to hunger. 

“...Ah, but I might need some help. Since I’m so weak and all.” 

“Alright, leave it to me.” Lutz enthusiastically flexed his arms. Seeing that, 
his older brothers all rushed forward and pushed him out of the way. 

“You’re not getting it all for yourself, Lutz. We’ll help too, Myne.” 

“Yup, yup. I’m a lot stronger than Lutz.” 

“Yay! Okay, I want you three to get a metal pan ready for baking. Lutz can 


get the ingredients ready and Ralph can mix them. Oh, and it wouldn’t be fair to 
just use Lutz’s juice, so let’s all use a little bit of everyone’s. Come on, let’s see 
the juice. No hiding.” 

I clapped my hands together while giving Lutz and his brothers cooking 
instructions. I was too small and weak to do much, so it was up to these hungry 
young men to do the work for me. 

“Lutz, would you get two eggs and some milk? Ralph, mix them together 
with that spatula over there. Zasha and Sieg, heat the pan in the furnace.” 

Lutz prepared the ingredients for me as I put them one by one in the bowl. 
Ralph began mixing them with the wooden spatula. Zasha and Sieg behind us 
got the metal pan and heated it up in the furnace. 

“Okay, that should be good. Lutz, do you have butter?” 

Lutz held out some butter, which I scooped with a spoon and put onto the 
metal pan after climbing onto a somewhat tall chair. The butter sizzled on the 
pan and melted, filling the air with a nice smell. 

I then used a big spoon to pour the “batter” Ralph had mixed in the bowl. It 
hissed, cooking, and the butter scent was joined by the sweet smell of a parue. 
Since I was using the okara-esque leftovers in place of wheat, it ended up baking 
into more of a flat cookie than a pancake, but it was still basically what I had 
expected. 

“And that’s how you do it. Would you all work together to make more?” 
After showing them how to make one, I got off the chair and let the tall older 
brothers take care of everything. They had figured out what to do already, so 
they immediately borrowed the cooking tools from me and started making their 
own. 

“When they get bumpy it means they're ready. You should turn that one over 
now.” 

“Right.” Zasha flipped it over and I saw that it was cooking nicely. I heard 
everyone swallow hard. 

“Move this one over there. You can cook another one in the open spot.” Once 
it had cooked well enough, he moved it aside and poured more butter and batter 
in its place. After I checked to make sure they were cooked properly, we moved 
them from the pan to a plate, stacking one on top of the other. 

“Tadaaa! (Simple Okara Pancakes)!" I held the plate and puffed out my chest 
with pride, “eheh”-ing once again. 


But my words must not have gotten through, given how Lutz was looking at 
me. “...Wha? Say that again?” 

“Ummm... Simple Parue Cakeeees...” The steaming-hot parue cakes were 
lined across the table, wafting off a sweet scent and looking super delicious. 

“Go ahead and eat up. But be careful, it’s hot.” I took a bite and chewed 
slowly. The parue cake was so tasty it honestly shocked me. It was surprisingly 
fluffy and wasn’t coarse or dry at all, unlike the bird food. Probably due to the 
parue fruit juice inside, it tasted plenty sweet even without jam or anything. 

“Hey, Lutz. These were pretty simple to make, right? And don’t they fill you 
right up?” 

“They do. Myne, I dunno what to say. You’re amazing.” 

Since tons of people came to Lutz’s house looking to trade for eggs, they had 
plenty of parue leftovers, and thanks to their birds, they had as many eggs as 
they wanted. They could trade eggs for milk, too, so they could make parue 
cakes all winter. 

“Now you’ll be able to spend the winter with a full stomach.” 

“Yep!” Lutz bit into his parue cake happily. As I watched him eat, several 
recipes that used okara passed through my head. 

“I know of some other ways to use parue leftovers, but I’m too weak to make 
them myself.” 

“I’ll make them for you if you just teach me how. Now that you’ve taught me 
about food this good, you’re kind of like a god to me, so yeah. I've got your 
back, Myne.” 

That event served as the beginning of me having Lutz and his brothers make 
recipes for me that required arm strength. I taught them the recipes and taste 
tested the results. Lutz and his brothers ate the food and got full. It was a nice 
give and take relationship. 


Helping Out Otto 

In this city the people go too gather parties on sunny winter days. Dad and 
Tuuli went together last time since it was his day off, but this time, he had work. 

I thought for sure we’d just give up on them, until I saw Mom grabbing her 
coat. “I’ll be going with Tuuli today.” 

There were plenty of ways to use parue and our family wanted as many as 
possible. Since I was pretty useless when it came to anything involving going 
outside, I wanted to at least show emotional support. 

Good luck, Tuuli! You can do it! I believe in you, Mom! 

The problem with Mom going with Tuuli to the forest, however, was what to 
do with me. I was weak, sickly, and generally dead weight. They wouldn’t bring 
me to the forest knowing I’d end up bedridden with a fever. But they couldn’t 
leave me alone, either, as they had no idea what I would do if left to my own 
devices. It hurt to hear that, but to be honest, they weren’t wrong. 

Dad, after falling into thought for a bit while preparing for work, suddenly 
clapped his hands together. “...I’ve got it! Myne, how about you wait at the gate 
with me?” 

Dad would take me to the gate. Mom and Tuuli would go gather parues in the 
forest. On their way back, they would pick me up at the gate and take me home. 
We would get our parues and I wouldn’t be left home alone. Everybody wins. 

“That’s an excellent idea. Okay, Tuuli. We’re leaving Myne with Gunther.” 

“Right! See you later, Myne.” 

Mom, congratulating Dad on his idea, quickly prepared her things and left 
with Tuuli in no time. They had to leave fast since you could only gather parues 
before noon. 

“Alright, ready to go? The gate’s waitin’.” 

Weeell... It’ll be a nice change of pace from home, I guess. And Otto can 
teach me some new letters if he’s there, so... 

Honestly, I had gotten tired of spending all day at home. Having failed at 
making faux-papyrus, the only thing I could do at home was play with my slate 
or make baskets. Never in my life had I expected that I would end up with so 
much spare time. Books had been the only things saving me from a life of 


boredom. 

Incidentally, the song “Ham yo, Koi” (Come forth, Spring) has been playing 
non-stop in my head. The sooner spring comes, the sooner I can go outside and 
make clay tablets. To that end, I was exercising every morning in hopes of 
building up enough stamina to make going outside manageable. 

My family looked at me weird, but I knew that physical fitness was best 
accomplished bit by bit, day by day, with a lot of determination. Though to tell 
the truth, as I had been exceedingly unhealthy in my Urano days, I hardly knew 
any proper exercise routines. I was just winging it. 

“Dad, is Otto there today?” 

“Yeah, I think so.” 

“Yay! I’ll bring my slate to the gate, then.” 

Now waiting at the gate’s going to be fun. I hurriedly got my own things 
together, the most important thing being my stone slate. 

After bundling on layers and squeezing into my coat, I grabbed the wooden 
tote bag I had woven over the winter and put my stone slate into it, plus the slate 
pencil. Preparations complete. 

“Let’s go, Dad!” 

“...Myne, you like Otto that much?” 

“Uh huh, I really like him.” I mean, he’s my teacher (or so I’ve unilaterally 
decided), and he gave me this slate. How could I not like him? 

We left home and it took about half a second for me to realize the air itself 
was icy cold. Just a little bit of wind brushing my skin was enough to make me 
twinge with pain. My face was tingling so hard that even I, queen of all 
lazybones, immediately began hatching a plan to turn parue oil into some kind of 
moisturizing cream. 

“Bwuh! So cold!” 

Not to mention that the snow was so deep I couldn’t walk in it. There may 
have been some trick to snow walking, but as I hadn’t grown up in a snowy area, 
I had no idea what it was. 

It took exactly two steps for my stubby child legs to get stuck in the snow, 
rendering me immobile. My fate was sealed. My future, gone. I could only cry 
out into the void for help, hoping someone came to my rescue. 

“Dad! How do you walk through snow?” 

“...Enough already. Hold on tight and don’t fall off.” 

I was holding my arms out to maintain my balance, legs stuck in the snow, 
when Dad turned around and walked back with an exasperated expression on his 


face. He put my tote bag around his neck and stuck his hands beneath my arms 
before lifting me up into the air and resting me on his shoulders. 

“Wooow! So tall. This is so cool.” My line of sight shot up much higher than 
when Ralph carried me. The only reason the sudden height didn’t terrify me was 
that Dad’s shoulders, thanks to his job as a soldier, were wide and muscular. I 
could rest on them without fear. 

Back in my Urano days I had barely ever interacted with my father, but I did 
have a few memories of him. He did carry me once, when we went to watch the 
sakura trees bloom. 

“Be sure to hold on tight, alright?” 

It had been so long since someone carried me on their shoulders that my heart 
was beating a little fast. After I clung to his head, Dad started walking through 
the snow. The alley to the road hadn’t been swept and thus he carefully traced 
the existing footsteps for a bit before reaching the main road and walking 
normally again. 

“Myne, just so you know, Otto’s already married,” said Dad, breaking the 
silence with something entirely unexpected. 

Um... What? Did I ever say I wanted to marry Otto? I don’t think so. I’ve 
never said anything about marrying anyone. 

“Ummm... So?” 

“His wife is everything to him, alright?” 

What exactly are you trying to stop your five-year-old daughter from doing? 
Even if I did like him in that way, he wouldn’t give a five-year-old the time of 
day. You sure are being dumb, Dad. 

Regardless of realizing what my dad was thinking, I kept quiet. He was being 
a pain and I definitely wouldn’t reward his petulant behavior with a “You’re way 
more amazing, Dad! ” or a “I love you more, Dad! ” 

“So you’re saying that Otto’s an amazing person that’s all about treating his 
wife well?” 

“...No.” That made Dad so sulky that he kept silent the rest of the way. 

And thus, upon the shoulders of the most tedious father in the world, I arrived 
at the gate. 

“Good morning.” On instinct I bowed my head to the guards standing at the 
gate. They looked at me for a second, reminding me that bowing heads was not a 
customary greeting in this world. Or maybe they were just surprised to see me 
on my Dad’s shoulders. 

“This is Myne, my daughter. My wife will come get her when she’s done 


gathering pames. Until then, keep her in the night watch’s room.” 

“Understood.” 

“Got that, Myne? Otto should be there too. You’re welcome.” 

Oof... Dad sounds kinda peeved. Wait, is Dad so jealous that he’s gonna be 
mean to Otto? Is this complex web of human relationships falling apart? 

“Um, well, I’m just looking forward to Otto teaching me new letters.” 

“Why’s it have to be Otto?” 

Welp... Sorry, Otto. I tried backing you up but I think I just made things 
worse. I don’t know why Dad has to get so jealous. I’m just looking forward to 
learning. It’s at times like these that I realize I don’t know too much about father- 
daughter relationships. 

“I’m coming in.” Dad gave a light knock on the door and walked in. 

The night watch's room had a brightly burning furnace and a lamp on the 
nearby deck, making it much brighter than our place. The desk was pretty close 
to the furnace and Otto was doing paperwork on it. 

“Otto.” 

“Captain... and Myne? What’s the occasion?” 

“She’s staying here until the parue gathering is done. Keep an eye on her.” 
Dad kept his instructions brief, arguably blunt, and set me onto the ground. 

The sudden addition of babysitting to his duties naturally surprised Otto, and 
he looked between Dad and his paperwork with a troubled expression. 

“Huh? Er, but... I’m busy with these financial reports, budget calculations, 
and...” 

“Myne. It’s warm here. Make sure not to catch a cold.” Dad left, ignoring 
Otto entirely. 

I waved him goodbye and turned to look at Otto. “Sorry about this, Mr. Otto. 
It’s just that, well, getting this slate made me really happy, and seeing you again 
today made me even happier.” 

“I’m glad to hear that. It’s nice to see you too, Myne, but uh...” Otto gave an 
awkward laugh and continued, “But that’s nothing to apologize for, right?” with 
a puzzled expression. 

“The truth is, I complimented you a lot in front of Dad, and he got really 
jealous...” 

“...Aaaah.” 

“So, will you teach me new letters? I’ll be quiet and stay out of your way 
until Mom comes to get me.” I could tell from the parchment and ink on the 
table that he had been in the middle of paperwork. I didn’t intend to get in the 


way of his work, but I also didn’t intend to miss an opportunity to learn new 
letters. 

“Well, alright. Somehow I get the feeling you actually will stay quiet and 
study, Myne,” murmured Otto as he took my slate and scribbled letters onto it. 

This world’s writing system was similar to the English alphabet. There were 
no syllabaries like hiragana, nor logograms like kanji. The letters themselves 
determined the sound and meaning of words. Spelling was everything. 

Otto had faith in my willingness to study quietly since I had spent hours 
playing with the slate after he first gave it to me. 

“Myne. We don’t want you catching a cold and putting the captain in an even 
worse mood, so here, sit next to me.” Otto gave a troubled smile and scooted a 
bit to the side, opening up more space by the furnace. 

I fully agreed with his assessment and sat next to him by the furnace without 
any unnecessary hesitation. “Thank you. It’ll be easier to study now.” 

For a bit, the room was filled only with the sounds of a scraping slate pen, the 
roaring of burning fire, and an ink pen sliding across parchment. After I had 
memorized the written letters, more or less, I looked up and saw Otto staring at 
the parchment in front of him, expression deadly serious as he did calculations. 

He did have an abacus-looking tool next to him, but I couldn’t tell how it 
worked from a glance. Though in the first place I had only ever used an abacus 
in elementary school when learning addition and subtraction, so even if it 
worked exactly like a Japanese abacus, I wouldn’t know how to use it. 

I waited until he finished a section of the paperwork before calling out to 
him. “Mr. Otto, what are you doing?” 

“Preparing financial reports and budgets. Over the winter we need to prepare 
a budget for next year and send it off before spring, but most soldiers aren’t great 
at math. I’m the most used to dealing with money, so I’m writing up our 
financial reports and budget.” 

“So everyone just pushed the hard work on you, hm?” 

I looked at the parchment, and although I couldn’t read the words, there were 
three stacked numbers beside a line of text. If I had to guess, the first number 
was the price of something, the second number was how many of that something 
they needed, and the third number was the resulting amount of money. It looked 
like the first two numbers had been multiplied to get the third, so yeah. 

I looked over the parchment, considering the possibility of it being a request 
for new equipment, when I spotted a math error. “Wait. Mr. Otto, isn’t this 
wrong?” 


“Wha?” 

“This is 75 and 30, right? I believe those actually make 2,250.” Although I 
could read the numbers, I didn’t know what they called multiplication in this 
world and thus had to be kind of vague in my explanation, but Otto seemed to 
understand me. 

“Wait, what? How can you do math when you don’t know how to read?” 

“Eheheh. My mom taught me numbers at the market. I can look at the 
numbers here and do math, but I can’t read anything around them.” 

After hearing that I couldn’t read what was written on the parchment, Otto 
began thinking about something. I heard him muttering to himself, “No, I 
shouldn’t... But...” back and forth. “...Myne, I’m going to swallow my pride to 
ask this. Would you please help me?” 

Um... Is this the kind of offer I should accept? I mean, putting aside all the 
problems regarding classified information, isn ’t it pretty out there to ask a kid for 
help? I guess he’s in such a tight spot that he’d welcome the help of anyone who 
can do math, even a child? 

He said that he was “swallowing his pride,” so I can imagine that it isn’t 
normal to ask kids for help. And I do want to help him, if he’s in that much 
trouble. Especially since I want something from him, too. This seems like the 
perfect place for some negotiating. 

“Okay, I’ll help. If you keep teaching me letters and get replacement slate 
pens for me.” 

“Wha?” He probably hadn’t expected a little girl to suddenly throw out 
conditions like that. His eyes opened wide. 

Smiling a little at his predictable reaction, I explained my situation. “Like I 
said, I know my numbers since Mom taught them to me. But I don’t know my 
letters. I want you to teach them all to me.” 

“I’m fine with that, but... What’s with the slate pens? They aren’t that 
expensive, are they?” Otto was right, they were sold all over the markets for 
cheap. 

“Mom and Dad used to buy them for me, but now they won’t, so...” 

“Why’d they stop?” 

“I play with the slate all day. No matter how many they buy, I always need 
more.” 

“Ahahahahah...” 

Hours of play a day was enough to wear out a slate pen in no time. Since I 
didn’t get any allowance, one could say that getting a steady supply of slate pens
