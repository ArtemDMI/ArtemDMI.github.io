To say it outright: Expecting me to consider making thread, weaving cloth, 
and sewing clothes for the family over winter as some important thing was just 
asking too much. I could say with confidence that I would never, ever care that 
much about it. I’d never feel motivated to do it. 

Though I would sew until my hands fell off if I could use the cloth as 
parchment. 

“You don’t want to join, Myne?” 

“Mmm, maybe next time.” 

Tuuli wanted me to join, but I really just did not want to sew anything. Mom 
was teaching Tuuli since she wanted to become an apprentice seamstress, but in 
my case, I lacked the height, hand size, and of course, motivation. Teaching me 
would be a waste of time. 

“Okay, Mom. Please make my special dress. I’ll make baskets.” 

“Certainly. Leave it to your mother. I’ll make you the prettiest, most 
wonderful dress you’ve ever seen.” Mom, confident in her sewing skills, spoke 
with eager enthusiasm. 

Every season, all children turning seven gathered at the temple wearing their 
best clothing. It was the perfect opportunity for a mother to show off her talent. 
In some ways, it was like a competition for mothers. My own mom began 
preparing the warp with a smile on her face, using thread much thinner than 
what Tuuli had been practicing with. 


“That thread looks really thin.” 

Mom gave me a conflicted smile as I thought about how long it would take to 
make cloth with that thread. “Well, her baptism is in the summer. Can you 
imagine how hot it would be without thin clothing?” 

“You’re making her dress in the winter even though her baptism is in the 
summer? Won’t she get bigger by then?” There was a lot more food and time to 
play around in the summer, so I figured most kids would grow a lot during it. 
What would happen if she grew too much and the dress ended up too small for 
her? 

“I can make little changes to it, so that won’t be problem. My main worry is 
that you’re so much smaller than her, Myne. You might not be able to wear the 
same dress. Fixing it that much will be quite the ordeal. I wonder what I’ll do 
next year?” 

Oof... That does sound rough. Good luck, Mom. 

Mom resumed weaving the cloth using the thin thread, which looked harder 
to work with than the wool thread they made earlier. Tuuli began making baskets 
to sell. Since my eyes had adjusted well enough to the dark, I decided to start 
making my own faux-papyrus, as my first giant step to accomplishing my 
dreams. 

If I can just weave these plant fibers together, I’ll definitely end up with 
something like paper. I won’t lose to ancient Egyptians! Let’s do this! 

I put the fibers on the table and thought back to the coasters I had been forced 
to make back in my Urano days. First, I would try to make a piece of paper 
about the size of a postcard. I got to work vertically and horizontally weaving 
the fibers that were much thinner than the thread mom was sewing with. 

I lacked money, skill, and age. This was a duel I had to win with guts, 
determination, and more guts. 

...Bwuuuh, they’re all so thin I can barely tell them apart. Fiddle fiddle fiddle 
fiddle... 

...Ah, I messed up! Fiddle fiddle fiddle fiddle... 

The fibers were so thin it wasn’t easy to fix any mistake I made. It all just fell 
apart. Frustrated, I continued my duel with the thin fibers, and eventually Tuuli 
stopped making her basket to peer over my shoulder. 

“Hey, Myne. What’re you doing?” 

“Hm? Making (faux-papyrus).” 

Tuuli looked back and forth between me and my hands. It was written all 
over her face that she hadn’t understood what I just said. 


Mmm, you can’t tell by looking? I haven’t even finished a one-inch wide 
square yet, so that’s fair. Not even I can tell if this is actually going to end up as 
good faux-papyrus. 

Mom, continuing to weave the cloth, looked at me fiddling with the plant 
fibers and sighed. 

Fiddle fiddle fiddle... 

Fiddle fiddle fiddle... 

“Myne, if you have the time to play around, help Tuuli make baskets 
instead.” 

“Mmm. Maybe when I’m not busy.” I wasn’t playing around, and I didn’t 
have the time to help Tuuli. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say I was the 
busiest I had ever been since starting my life as Myne. 

...Ah! I made another mistake. All because Mom called out to me. Geez! 

Fiddle fiddle fiddle... 

Fiddle fiddle fiddle... 

“Myne, seriously, what are you doing?” 

“I told you, making (faux-papyrus).” I didn’t have the mental leeway to 
respond gently to Tuuli ’s question, so my tone ended up a little sharp as I 
focused everything on fiddle fiddle fiddle... 

I didn’t hate working with my hands, and I was doing this because I wanted 
to. I just had to stay determined and keep going. 

Fiddle fiddle fiddle... 

Fiddle fiddle fiddle... 

“Um, Myne. It’s not getting any bigger.” 

“I know that!” Tuuli ’s comment served as the spark that finally made me yell 
in frustration. It took me a whole day just to get it the size of a fingertip. Please 
understand how I must have felt. 

Fiddle fiddle fiddle... 

Fiddle fiddle fiddle... 

The next day I relied on determination as well. Just keep going, I told myself 
as I wove the fibers together. I can’t let Tuuli ’s comments bother me. 

“What’s that even supposed to be?” 

« 55 

I can’t... let them bother me. I can’t let them bother me. 

Fiddle fiddle fiddle... 

Gah! It’s coming apart! Ngh, I just have to keep going! My heart will break if 


I try fixing it! Fiddle fiddle fiddle... 

“Hey, Myne...” 

“That’s it! I can’t do it! Okay, (ancient Egyptians), you win! I lose!” Mentally 
and emotionally exhausted, I clenched a fist around my faux-papyrus and yelled 
out in frustration. 

The faux-papyrus had ended up about the size of a tiny notecard. I had no 
idea how many days it would take if I were to try weaving the fibers into the size 
of an actual piece of paper, while keeping them tight enough to actually write on. 

Naturally, it would be impossible for me to make enough faux-papyrus to 
bind into a book at that rate. You could tell just by touching my card-sized faux- 
papyrus that I had lost patience with it midway through. The center was tightly 
woven, but the closer you got to the outside, the more frayed it was. No way 
would it have ended up as paper I could write on. 

At best, it could be a somewhat messy coaster. Not even good enough to 
write memos on. 

“Bwuuuuuh... I failed. My papyrus plan failed so hard.” The challenge 
involved in getting the materials, the difficulty of the creation process, and the 
overall time investment were all just too great for faux-papyrus to be mass 
produced. Even if I finished that sheet of faux-papyrus, it wouldn’t lead to me 
making a book. 

“Be quiet, Myne! If you have the time to play with plants, weave some 
baskets!” 

“Baskets won’t turn into books...” 

“I don’t know what you’re talking about, but you failed, didn’t you? Just start 
making baskets already.” 

Mom was so mad that I gave up and started weaving baskets. It was a lot 
simpler to weave the basket parts together than the super thin plant fibers. 

“Tuuli, I’ll help you make baskets. Would you mind sharing your stuff?” 

“Here, I’ll teach you.” Tuuli offered to help with a smile while gathering 
materials for me, but I just took them and shook my head. 

“It’s okay, I already know how.” 

“Wha?” Watching Tuuli blink in confusion out of the corner of my eyes, I 
started weaving a basket. I lined up the bamboo-esque, flat pieces of wood and 
delicately wove them together, making a tight basket with no gaps. 

This was really perfect timing for me, since I had been wanting a sort of take¬ 
out bag for a while. I decided to put my all into making the basket, partially to 
blow off steam after failing so hard with papyrus. After making a solid bottom, I 


calculated how to make the outside of the basket have a pretty design before 
starting to weave the rest of it. 

I kept weaving the pieces of wood, taking care not to hurt my hands, until the 
basket was done. It took me five whole days just to make a tiny chunk of faux- 
papyrus, but I finished my “tote bag” within a day. That was pretty good, 
considering how clumsy my tiny child hands were. 

“That’s amazing, Myne. I didn’t know you were a natural at this. Maybe you 
should try to be an apprentice carpenter?” 

“Whaaa? That’s a little...” 

Mom’s eyes beamed with joy, excited to see that her generally useless 
daughter had unexpected talent, but I had no intention of becoming an apprentice 
carpenter. I would work at a bookstore, library, or nowhere at all. Though it was 
a little problem that books were so rare that there were no bookstores or libraries 
to hire me. 

“Ngh, why are you so good at this, Myne?” Tuuli compared her baskets with 
mine and slumped her shoulders, depressed at how much worse hers were. 

“Don’t worry about it, Tuuli. You just need to learn how to tighten the gaps 
and plan ahead to make patterns.” 

I mean, the real difference here is just how much experience we have. Back in 
my Urano days, I had gotten wrapped up in my mom’s arts and crafts kick, 
where she folded newspaper advertisements and made baskets out of them. I had 
never expected that experience to be useful to me, but well, you never know 
where life will take you. 

“I can’t believe you’re better than me, Myneee...” 

Oh no... Looks like I’ve really hurt Tuuli ’s older sister pride. 

“Aaah, ummm... Right! Mrs. Gerda taught me while she was babysitting me. 
I’ve been doing this all the time while you’re out at the forest. You did a lot of 
other things while I made baskets, so you’re still better than me at almost 
everything. Really.” 

I didn’t have much experience with children, so I wasn’t sure how to put her 
back into a good mood. I did my best to make up an excuse for why I was so 
good, but honestly, I wasn’t even really sure what I was trying to say myself. 

“...Oh, okay. That’s right.” I wasn’t sure what part of that convinced her, but 
Tuuli looked a little relieved. “Okay, then I’ll make lots of baskets over the 
winter and get better than you, Myne.” 

“Uh huh. Good luck, Tuuli.” I let out a sigh of relief, glad to see Tuuli feeling 
better. It would be a lot harder for me to survive here without Tuuli’s help. If left 


on my own, I’d be helpless. I’m so glad I cheered her up. 

“Oh, Tuuli. You should force it into place a little more, it’ll look better that 
way.” Well... It’s not like I’m that happy about being good at making baskets. I 
just want books. 

I watched Tuuli ’s basket weaving and gave her advice while glancing at my 
failed faux-papyrus. If papyrus won’t work, what should I try making next? 
Throughout the winter, I thought about what to do next while continually 
weaving baskets next to Tuuli. 

...Egypt’s no good, it’s way too hard for a kid like me. What should I do if 
Egypt won’t work? Well, thinking about it like a textbook, you usually study 
Mesopotamian culture before Egyptian culture. 

...Okay, that’s it! Cuneiform! It’s time for clay tablets! Long live 
Mesopotamian culture! 

I remember that even after the flames of war and arson, their clay tablets 
managed to survive. I’ll make clay tablets, carve letters into them, cook them in 
a furnace, and that might just be that. Plus, making tablets out of clay will just 
look like a kid playing with mud. The adults won’t suspect a thing. 

It’s settled! That’s what I want to do. Once the snow melts and spring comes, 
I’m making clay tablets! 


The Sweet Taste of Winter 


“It’s sunny! Dad, it’s sunny! Come, wake up! Myne!” Tuuli’s excited voice 
rang through the dark bedroom and soon I was shaken awake. 

There had been harsh snowfall for the past few days, but upon waking up I 
saw dazzling sunlight streaming through the crack between our window doors. 
Wooow. Long time no see, Sun. 

Tuuli jumped off the bed in excitement and threw open the window covers 
without a care in the world for how cold it would be. A blue sky free of clouds 
stretched in all directions and the snow-swept city gleamed beneath the sun. 

“Look, the weather’s perfect. You have today off, right Dad? We gotta 
hurry!” 

“Yeah, yeah.” Dad, after scrunching his face from the bright sun hitting him 
head-on, jumped right out of bed. 

Everything following that happened fast. Tuuli and Dad scarfed down 
breakfast, got some things ready, and then hurriedly dashed outside. I was just 
getting to the table as Tuuli went through the door, wearing as much warm 
clothing as possible. 

“Bye bye, Myne. We’ll come back with lots of parues!” 

I waved Tuuli goodbye while blinking in confusion. Um... The heck’s a 
parue? I searched Myne’s memories and learned that it was a fruit that produced 
a sweet white drink that tasted really good. Tuuli said she’d bring some back, but 
I wasn’t really sure how she planned to do that. 

“Here’s breakfast, Myne. I need to go wash clothes. Those two will be 
bringing back parues for us, so I’ll be busy all afternoon.” 

Mom sliced up bread that I couldn’t cut or break on my own and dunked it 
into soup. Bread that had been baked until it was hard and black to prevent mold 
and last night’s leftover soup with a side of milk was our normal breakfast. 

Before I could even finish climbing onto my chair, Mom gathered up the 
dirty clothes that had built up over the snowstorm and left the house. I sat in the 
now-silent kitchen and chewed away at my breakfast alone. Once done, I began 
making baskets, the only thing I had ever done that anyone complimented me 
for. 


Dad and Tuuli must have known when Mom would be getting home, as they 
got back with broad grins right after she finished preparing for lunch. Seemed 
like their mission had been a success. 

“We’re back, Mom, Myne. We got three parues!” 

“Welcome home, you two. That’s fantastic. I have the dishes all set up and 
ready.” Mom pointed to a particularly deep bowl and went to get an especially 
thin piece of dry wood from the storage room, the kind used to start a fire. 

Tuuli used it to start a fire in the furnace and then poked a parue over the 
bowl. The moment she did, the outer layer burst around her finger and thick 
white juice flowed out. 

“Wow, it smells so gooood!” 

A sweet scent drifted through our home as the fruit juice slowly filled the 
bowl. I swallowed hard, it having been the first time I had smelled something 
sweet in a while. This was definitely the kind of thing that would give me good 
memories. 

Tuuli grabbed the bowl, making sure not to let any juice spill out, and Dad 
used the pressure weights to crush the juiced fmit. 

“Parues are amazing,” Tuuli explained to me. “Their juice is super sweet and 
tasty, and you can get oil from them. Even the leftovers can be used to feed 
livestock. We don’t have any animals, so we take ours to Lutz’s place and trade 
it for eggs.” 

“I bet a lot of people fight over them, then.” 

“Uh huh. You can only find them in the snow on sunny days like this, so a lot 
of us in the city go to the forest right away in the morning. Everyone wants as 
many as possible. But gathering them is really hard.” 

“Hard how?” 

Tuuli poked a hole in the second parue with a thin stick and once again 
slowly poured the juices into the bowl. The only thing I could do to help was 
hold the bowl down so it didn’t fall over. 

“To pick parue from trees, you have to heat up the branch holding it to soften 
it, but you can’t use any fire when up on top of the tree. The tree’s special 
powers will poof the fire away. So you have to take off your gloves and warm it 
with your bare hands.” 

“You have to take your gloves off in a winter this cold?! That does sound 
rough.” That was a one-way road to frostbite. Even if Dad and Tuuli took turns, 
heating up branches with your bare hands was just terrible work. “You can’t wait 


until noon to pick them? Won’t it be better when it’s warmer?” 

“Nope, nuh uh. You can only pick parues before noon.” Tuuli handed the 
drained parue to Dad and picked up the third one. She poked another hole into it 
and began squeezing out the juice. “Once noon comes and the sun rises, sunlight 
falls into the forest, and like, the parue leaves start shining, and the tree starts 
shaking, and the leaves all start making swishy swashy noises.” 

Er... The leaves shine, the trees shake on their own, and they make swishy 
swashy noises? What? Despite Tuuli’s best explanation, I couldn’t imagine that 
at all. 

“Once the leaves start making noises, the parue trees start stretching toward 
the sun. They grow taller than the rest of the trees in the forest and then they start 
shaking like a girl swinging her hair around. Like, rustle rustle, swish sway...” 

“...They stretch and start swaying around?” 

“Uh huh, right. The light hits its branches while it shakes around, and all the 
fruits we couldn’t gather shoot away, like pew! Once they’re all gone, the parue 
tree shrinks like it’s melting, and then it’s gone.” 

“They shoot away, and then the trees disappear...? That’s a weird kind of 
tree.” That was really all I had to say on the matter. What a weird tree. My weak 
imagination wasn’t enough to visualize that happening at all. 

“Okay, done. Want to try a little?” Tuuli poured most of the fruit juice into a 
jar, but left a little in the bowl. She drank two sips from it then handed me the 
bowl. 

I took two little sips just like Tuuli did. A thick, sweet flavor filled my mouth 
and on instinct I grinned ear to ear. This... This is what happiness tastes like! It’s 
like thick coconut milk! 

The moment I thought about drinking more, Tuuli said, “We don’t get a lot of 
this fruit juice, so we need to really, really, really treasure it. Don’t drink it all at 
once.” 

Okay, okay, I’ll take it slow. 

“Dad, are you going to squeeze this one too?” Tuuli held up the cloth bag and 
peered inside of it. 

“Yep,” said Dad as he crushed the parue bit by bit with the pressure weights. 
Parue oil could be used for cooking and in lamps, which made it kind of like 
olive oil. 

“Tuuli, let me see.” I peered into the bag from the side, wanting to see what 
parues looked like after getting their oil extracted. Inside I saw what looked like 
okara, which was a Japanese food made from soybean pulp. It smelled sweet. 


“This stuff smells really sweet. Can you really not eat it?” I stuck a hand into 
the bag and experimentally plopped some of it into my mouth. 

“Myne! That’s bird food!” Tuuli hurriedly took the bag away from me and 
told me to spit the stuff out, but I just chewed it thoughtfully. 

The squeezed-dry stuff was rough and not nearly as sweet as it smelled. 
Overall, I understood why it wasn’t exactly considered good food for humans. 
But it definitely could be used like okara, in a good way. I took a bit of the stuff 
and dripped it into the fruit juice bowl to hydrate it a little. 

“What’re you doing, Myne?” 

“...I think it’ll be edible if I do this.” 

“I’m telling you, that’s bird food! It’s not something for people to eat.” 

I nodded and stuck some of it into my mouth. It was actually pretty good. If I 
mixed the leftovers with fruit juice, and ideally added some eggs and milk, I 
could probably make a good okara pancake. 

“...Uh huh, it’s good.” 

“It’s not good!” I pushed a bit of the parue leftovers mixed with fruit juice 
into Tuuli ’s mouth. At first she yelled “What’re you doing?!” but after a bit, she 
started chewing with a conflicted look on her face. 

“Okay, let’s go.” 

Tuuli and I left to go to Lutz’s house. It was the sixth floor of the house 
directly across from ours in the circular cluster of buildings that made up our 
neighborhood. I did my best climbing up and down two sets of stairs in order to 
trade the leftovers of two parues for eggs. It was pretty rough climbing the six 
floors to his place after climbing down the five from mine. 

.../’// make a faux-pancake for them after the trade. Eheheh. 

“Excuse meee.” 

“Lutz, here. We’ll trade you these for eggs.” I held out the bag with a full 
smile, but Lutz just frowned a little. 

“We’ve already got enough animal feed. Got any meat instead? My older 
brothers keep stealing all of mine.” 

Everyone spent a lot more time inside during the winter, so it was more likely 
for them to steal his food. Lutz grumbled about being hungry all the time. Tuuli 
just gave a sympathetic smile and said “It’s hard to fight back when they’re so 
much bigger,” but really, it was hard to describe how bad it felt to be hungry all 
the time. 

I held the bag out, planning to help solve his problem. “Okay, Lutz. Why not 


just eat this?” 

“Who would eat bird food?!” His reaction was as expected. Nobody around 
here ate it like okara. 

“...Iks edible if you make it right.” 

“Huh?” 

“It’s only inedible cause you squeeze all the juices out. They taste really good 
if you make them properly, even the leftovers.” 

Lutz looked at Tuuli in disbelief. He was definitely thinking that there was 
nobody in the world who would eat bird food. 

“Seriously?! You’re just being wasteful! Sure, you could eat the parue and be 
done, but it’s way more efficient to use them to make juice, oil, and bird feed! 
Nobody wastes the fruit by just eating them on the spot! I can’t believe anyone 
would work so hard to get the fruit and just eat it without using it properly. 
There’s nobody dumb enough to do that in this whole town, Myne! Except you, I 
guess!”
