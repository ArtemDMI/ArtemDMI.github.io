“Why didn’t you tell us about those parue burgers during the winter?” 

“You need fresh meat to mince it like that, right? And it was really hard to 
mince it in the first place. Who knows what would have happened without all 
your help...” 

“Aaah, yeah, that was pretty rough. But we’ll do anything for your food, 
Myne.” 

I didn’t have the strength to keep chopping the meat until it was all minced 
up, and I couldn’t ask Mom to do it knowing how difficult it was. I hadn’t been 
able to eat anything like a hamburger in so long, I felt really lucky that Lutz and 
his brothers were willing to make some with me. 

We walked all the way to the forest while chatting. It was so much fun that I 
managed to walk such a long distance without stopping, but the exhaustion after 
we got there was overwhelming. I sat on a somewhat large rock and just focused 
on recuperating energy while everyone else went gathering. 

Worried about how heavily I was breathing, Lutz patted my back. 
“Remember, Fey and Tuuli’s baptisms are coming up. You gotta get used to 
walking to the forest real soon.” 

“...Why?” I knew Tuuli’s baptism was soon given how we’d spent the winter 
making clothes and her hair ornament, but I didn’t understand what specifically 


would change after it happened. 

“Once a kid gets baptized, they start apprentice work, right? That’ll mean for 
about half of each week, you’ll be the only one in your family who has time to 
go to the forest, Myne.” 

I opened my eyes wide in surprise. Tuuli starting apprentice work meant that 
I would have to help around the house more in her stead. 

“Wh-What should I do...? I didn’t think about that.” Past Myne managed to 
live this long without doing anything since Tuuli was such a good older sister 
that took care of her. Without Tuuli, I probably wouldn’t be able to survive. 

Lutz cackled and rubbed his nose as he saw the blood drain from my face. 
“Hey, don’t sweat it. I’ll always protect you, Myne, whether Tuuli’s there or not. 
Cause you’re so small and weak.” 

Lutz was too kind. He’s had that kind of manly attitude ever since I first met 
him as Myne. “Thanks, Lutz. I’ll be counting on you.” 

“Yeah. I’m gonna go gather firewood. Sit there and rest while I’m gone, 
alright? You don’t wanna be too tired to go home.” Lutz left it at that and went to 
get firewood. Once his footsteps faded into the distance and there was nobody 
around me, I grabbed my wannabe-spade and started digging a hole. 

My goal for today was “Go to the forest and get home. Try not to catch a 
fever.” I knew that. But although I felt bad for Lutz and my family, could I bear 
coming to the forest and then just leaving without doing anything? No, I 
couldn’t. 

...Dig, dig! Dig as far as you can! I wanted sticky clay, but who knew how 
much I could get. Assuming the ground layer here was similar to Earth’s, I’d 
need to dig fairly deep to find sticky clay. 

“Hyah!” I thrust the spade into the ground, putting all my strength into it. But 
the flimsy branch my family called a spade didn’t even go a single centimeter 
into the ground. 

...So hard! Bwuh? Is it even possible to dig into this? It felt like trying to dig 
into the packed dirt of a sports field. I had expected the ground of the forest to be 
moist and soft, but reality couldn’t be more different. Was it the ground’s fault, 
or the spade’s fault? The answer was simple. 

Yep... It’s the spade. The spade I was holding was a far cry from the ones I 
was used to. If only it were at least made of metal, not wood. But alas. 

Regardless of the spade being wood, regardless of how hard or soft the ground 
was, giving up wasn’t an option for me. I just had to keep digging bit by bit, 
even if my progress ended up being pathetic. 


Scratch scratch scratch... 

The flimsy branch of a spade scraped the ground away bit by bit. It took a lot 
of strength and determination to dig out sticky clay. It would take a lot more than 
a single day to finish this. Somehow, I got the feeling making tablets out of the 
clay would be hard too. I could only pray that it would be easier than making 
faux-papyrus. 

Scratch scratch scratch... 

After digging about five centimeters into the ground, I heard someone 
approaching. 

“What are you doing, Myne?” Lutz, both hands filled with gathered twigs, 
opened his eyes wide in shock after seeing me sitting on the ground digging with 
a spade. “Didn’t you promise not to do anything that would tire you out?!” 

I remembered the promise we made after I left home, but I couldn’t resist 
digging for the clay that was right in front of my eyes. I had intended to stop 
before Lutz came back, but it was hard to quit after getting started. 

...Wh-What should I say? I could fool Dad with a hug and a smile, but Tuuli 
had specifically assigned Lutz to watch over me. There was no fooling him. If I 
tried, he’d just narrow his eyes and interrogate me further. I knew that from 
experience. 

“U-Um... Well, Lutz.” 

“...Well what?” Lutz furrowed his brows, put his hands on his hips, and 
looked down on me. The interrogation had started. “I told you to rest. Why 
aren’t you? What are you doing?” 

“...U-Ummm, digging a hole!” Lutz’s intimidating pose and aura of anger 
overwhelmed me such that I accidentally let the truth spill out. I-I mean, Lutz is 
scary when he gets mad. If things go bad, I won’t make it home before the gate 
closes. 

“I can see that. Why were you digging?” I thought answering honestly would 
do the trick, but Lutz’s anger just multiplied. I felt his gaze get a lot, lot colder. 
Groaning fearfully to myself, I looked up at Lutz. 

“Ummm, well, I want (sticky clay).” 

“Huh? You want what?” Lutz tilted his head a little bit in confusion. It 
seemed like the confusion had dimmed his anger somewhat. 

“I want, um... ground that’s heavy, bad at draining water, and all clumped 
together. Sticky.” 

“...If that’s what you want, you’ll find more of it over there, where there’s not 
much grass or trees.” 


It was true that it’d be more efficient to search for ground where plants 
weren’t growing, since too much water actually made it harder for them to grow. 

“Good thinking, Lutz! Thanks!” 

“Hey! Stop, Myne!” I tried moving over there immediately, but Lutz grabbed 
the back of my neck and pulled me back. He was incomparably bigger and 
stronger than me, so I had no way of escaping him. 

“Your job today is to rest, remember? Did you not hear me? What’s so 
important that you gotta dig for it right now?” Lutz followed up his neck grab by 
pulling my ears. I wailed while flailing my arms around. 

“Ow! Ow! It’s something I really, really want...! But it’s not something we 
can eat or anything, so I can’t ask Tuuli to get it for me!” I glared at Lutz with 
tears in my eyes while rubbing my ears, which made him falter a little. He must 
not have expected me to argue back, or maybe he was just surprised to see me 
get so stubborn about something when I usually didn’t. 

My raw instincts told me not to let this opportunity slip me by. “Are you 
saying you’ll dig for me if I rest?!” 

“...I’ll dig for you once I finish getting enough firewood. So c’mon, Myne, 
rest.” His unexpected answer made me freeze up. I could only stare at him, 
stunned. Although I had led the conversation in that direction, I had to wonder if 
Lutz understood what he was saying. Rather than helping me make my clay 
tablets, he should focus on gathering as much as possible for his family. 

“Lutz, um, I appreciate the thought, but shouldn’t you, um, focus on 
yourself?” 

“You’re too weak to dig up clay. So, I’ll do it. But in return, tell me what 
you’ll use the clay for. What you want to do with it.” 

“...Why?” 

“I can save time and avoid wasted effort if I know what you want to do. 
’Cause I mean, look, you were digging in the wrong place for what you wanted.” 

Ngh... I can’t argue with that. It was true that even with a clear goal in mind, I 
struggled a lot due to not knowing what things were called in this world, not 
noticing that things looked different here from what I had seen in my Urano 
days, and not having access to the tools I needed. Thanks to Lutz firmly pointing 
out my error, I knew that he hadn’t said he would help without thinking, but I 
didn’t know why he was willing to help. It made me feel weird. 

“Why are you willing to help me, Lutz?” 

“Huh? I mean, you made those parue cakes for me when I was real hungry, 
right? That day I decided to help you with whatever you needed. No matter 


what.” 

...Bwuh? Just that? He’ll help me dig out clay just for that? To be honest, it 
was hard for me to understand Lutz’s willingness to perform hard labor for me, 
but maybe he was just the kind of person who cared a lot about repaying 
gratitude. If he wanted to help, that was fine with me. I felt kinda bad about it, 
but when it came to matters of strength, I would leave everything I could to him. 

“...Okay, Lutz, I’ll leave it to you. I can just wait here.” 

“Alright. I’ll be back in no time.” Lutz really did finish picking up firewood 
in no time. He then led me to ground with poor water drainage. It was a lower 
point in the forest, with slanted ground surrounding it. 

“Should be around here.” Lutz took the twig-like spade I brought with me 
and started digging with it. “Myne. Y’know, thinking about it, why’d you even 
bring this spade with you? You never intended to keep our promise, huh?” 

“Ah?! U-Um, that’s, well... I was just so excited to go to the forest. I just 
accidentally brought the stuff I needed with me.” 

Lutz flinched a bit, and thrust the spade hard into the ground as if to release 
his burning emotions. “Sheesh! You look all nice and sweet on the outside, but I 
can’t let my guard down around you!” 

“Actually, I think you should let your guard down a bit more... Why do you 
have to be smarter than Dad?” 

“Mr. Gunther is just too soft on you!” 

I could only watch silently as Lutz used his anger to dig. Somehow, the twig 
was steadily making progress through the ground. Unlike my scratching, the 
ground was getting flung away chunk by chunk. It was so weird, I couldn’t 
understand it. Is he just that much stronger than me? Is he holding the spade 
differently? Is there some trick here? 

“Wait, is it just me or is the ground a different color now?” After Lutz dug 
about fifty centimeters into the ground, it changed color. “Is this the stuff you 
want?” 

I grabbed some of it and tried squeezing it in my hand. It was cold, heavy, 
and changed shape inside of my hand. This was definitely the sticky clay I had 
been looking for. “This is it! It would have taken me days to dig this far! You’re 
amazing, Lutz. So strong.” 

“There’s not a guy alive who’s not stronger than you, Myne.” Despite 
sounding peeved, Lutz kept on digging up the sticky clay. 

Giddy with excitement, I brought chunks of the clay and set them on top of a 
large rock, bit by bit. I wonder how many clay tablets this will make. That alone 


made me grow terribly fond of this clay, as silly as that sounded. 

“So, what do you need this stuff for?” 

“Eheh. I’m gonna make (clay tablets) with it.” 

“(Clay tablets)?” 

“Uh huh.” 

I took the clay, acquired through Lutz’s hard labor, and squished it into the 
shape of a thin tablet. I then grabbed a nearby, tiny stick and started carving in a 
Japanese bedtime story that my old mom had told me. I would have preferred to 
write in the language of this world, not Japanese, but Otto was only teaching me 
words that had to do with work. I could write the basic template for a letter of 
introduction, and I could write out various things related to noble offices, but I 
couldn’t write words related to my basic daily life. 

“Are those letters you’re writing?” 

“Uh huh, basically. If I write something down here, I can remember it later 
just by reading. Written records are amazing, don’t you think? And books are 
just filled with these written records, so they’re even more amazing.” 

“Wow...” 

“Lutz, thanks for digging up this clay. You really saved me. If you still need 
to gather stuff, go ahead. I’ll be sitting right here and writing.” 

“Alright. You better stay still.” 

I was writing a story aesthetically similar to “The Elves and the Shoemaker: 
Isekai Edition.” It was such an epic tale that even if I packed each clay tablet 
with letters, I would need ten to tell the whole story. 

“Yaaay! I finished!” Upon writing the last word and settling things with a 
climatic “Fin,” I was struck with a sense of overwhelming accomplishment. 
Wow! Clay tablets! I finished the clay tablets! Oh great and mighty 
Mesopotamian culture, may you live forever! 

I would be finished for real once I heated the tablets on our hearth, such that 
they wouldn’t break. I squeezed my stick and turned around to see the other 
finished tablets I had stacked on top of one another. 

“GYAAAAAAAAAAAH!” I slapped my hands on my cheeks and screamed 
in a way that made me the spitting image of Edvard Munch’s The Scream. What 
I saw before me was so unbelievable my mind went white. 

Lutz, holding his gathering basket, rushed back to where I was. “What’s 
wrong, Myne?!” 

“Fey stepped on them! He messed them up! ...UWAAAH!” The first half of 


the story I had put all into writing — more than half really — had turned into 
mush beneath Fey and his friends’ feet. The tablets had crumbled apart and the 
footsteps covering them made the text unreadable. 

“I-I had finally finished them... So mean! Uwaaah! How hard do you think I 
worked to come here? ! How hard do you think it was for me to make this weak, 
sick body stronger...?! I even wrapped Lutz and Tuuli into this to finish them, 
and yet! GAAAH! STUPID DUMB IDIOOOTS!” 

I glared at Fey and the others as hard as I could, choking back sobs as tears 
streamed down my face. Rage coursed through my body as if to set my blood 
boiling, but somehow, my mind was frighteningly calm. I knew on the inside I 
was being immature, but I couldn’t calm myself down. 

Fey and his friends flinched from my glare and slowly backed away, 
trembling in fear. 


...I was almost there! I was one step away from getting a book, and now it’s 
all a mess! How are they going to make up for this? As I began thinking of ways 
to cool my rage over my clay tablets being messed up, Tuuli came running over 
with a terrified look on her face, probably having heard my scream. 

“Myne, what’s wrong?!” She peered over to see my face and immediately her 
expression twisted into one of fear, just like Fey’s. “...What happened? You look 
really, really mad.” She averted her eyes from me and looked around to assess 
the situation while consoling me. “Myne, you can’t let yourself get that mad. I’m 
sure they didn’t mean to hurt your feelings, right?” 

Whether or not they meant to hurt me, the ruined clay tablets wouldn’t be 
coming back. My rage over all my efforts being wasted couldn’t be calmed by 
Tuuli ’s words alone. 

“Whatever! I’m never gonna forgive them!” With tears and snot trickling 
down my face, I glared with all my might at Fey and his friends as they quivered 
in terror, before suddenly Lutz patted me on the back. 

“I remember you saying you spent three months building up strength just so 
you could go to the forest and make (clay tablets). I get why you’re mad. I get 
why you don’t want to forgive them, I really do. But no matter how mad you get, 
what’s done is done. The only thing you can do is make them again. And uh, 
yeah, I’ll help you.” 

“If we start right now, we can make it to the gate before it closes. I’ll help, 
Myne. Okay? Fey and the others feel bad about what they did, so they’ll help 
too. Right?” 

“Yeah, definitely! We didn’t think they mattered that much to you. Sorry, 
seriously.” Clinging to the lifesaver thrown to them by Lutz and Tuuli, Fey and 
the others nodded their heads hard and hurriedly reached to the tablets they had 
been stepping on. Fey’s apology and the assurance that we could make new ones 
before the gate closed made the anger drain out of me. Staying angry wouldn’t 
be as productive as getting to work making new tablets. 

“...Okay. I’ll make new ones.” I had more or less managed to finish writing 
the story on the old tablets, so my approach in making them wasn’t flawed. I had 
to be satisfied with how much easier they were to make than papyrus. 

But I didn’t forget to drive the point home to Fey and his cronies. “Don’t 
think any of you will get a second chance.” 

Apparently, I reigned as the queen of the rumored “Top People You Should 
Never Make Angry” rankings for some time. 


Clay Tablets Won’t Work 

As expected by basically everyone, going to the forest, making clay tablets, 
and exploding with rage all took so much out of me that I ended up bedridden 
with a fever. Apparently I had murmured “clay tablets” under my breath over 
and over the whole time. 

I clenched my fists, resolved to go right to the forest to make more clay 
tablets, but Dad wouldn’t let me. “No way, not a chance! We gotta see how your 
health holds up. Wait until tomorrow. Alright?” 

“...Okaaaay.” Naturally, he wouldn’t give me permission to do something as 
reckless as go straight to the forest the day after recovering from a fever. But 
still, he said I could go to the forest tomorrow if I didn’t get another fever today, 
so I started preparing for tomorrow with excitement in my heart. 

First, I took a board from the storage room (whose true purpose I didn’t 
know) and put it on the bottom of my basket for stability. I then took some torn- 
up cloths that Mom was intending to sew into rags and stealthily put them into 
my bag. With all that done, I could wrap the clay tablets up and bring them home 
with me. 

Okaaay, time to make tons and tons of clay tableeets! I woke up in 
excitement the next morning, but it was raining hard. In fact, it was a torrential 
downpour, which was rare for this area. Things were so bad it was like a 
typhoon. We could hear the wind and rain even after tightly shutting our 
windows. 

“NOOOO! Rain?!” In a world without weather forecasts, we were at the 
mercy of Mother Nature’s whims. Or really, I was sick so much that I only ever 
left the house when my family said I could, which meant up until now I never 
had to worry about the weather. 

Visions of the clay tablets falling apart beneath the rain flashed through my 
mind. Although I had hidden them beneath some sturdy-looking shrubbery, they 
would definitely not survive this storm unharmed. 

“NGYAAAAAH! My (clay tablets)! They’re gonna turn into mush!” 

“Hold it, Myne! Just where do you think you’re going?!” 


“To the forest!” I immediately tried running outside without a second 
thought, but Mom grabbed the back of my neck and stopped me. 

“What in the world are you thinking? ! You already get sick so easily, this 
storm would kill you! Do you not realize it’s so bad we can’t even go to the 
well?!” 

The sounds of the storm raged through our home despite the tightly shut 
windows, emphasizing just how bad the storm really was. I would never survive 
outside if even healthy adults hesitated to step outside to reach the well. 

I sunk to the floor. “My (clay tableeets)... Awww...” 

“Don’t worry, Myne. Everyone said they’ll help you, so you’ll be able to 
make new ones faster than before. You don’t need to get super mad again.” Tuuli 
mbbed my head, consoling me. She really was a good older sister. 

The rare storm continued for two days, and it took another two days after that 
before we kids were allowed to go to the forest again. 

It was a bright and sunny morning, and everyone looked excited to visit the 
forest again after so long. And today was a day where apprentices didn’t have 
work, so there were a lot more kids than usual, especially big ones. Lutz’s older 
brother Ralph was going to the forest too. He had a large basket on his back and 
was carrying a bow. 

“Heya, Myne. Feeling better?” 

“Hi, Ralph. I’ve been better, but the day Dad said I could go to the forest 
again, the storm hit.” 

“Now that’s rough.” Ralph rustled my hair and then went to see Tuuli. “Sup, 
Tuuli.” 

“Ralph! It feels like it’s been forever since we saw each other.” Perhaps due 
to having started work as an apprentice, Ralph looked a lot more mature and 
confident in himself. And Tuuli, who I had been cleaning up in preparation for 
her baptism, beamed an angelic smile. 

...Uh huh, these two would definitely be a nice couple, I think. Ralph and 
Tuuli both care a lot about others, so I think they would be a good fit for each 
other. I watched the two of them, grinning, when suddenly Lutz pulled me over 
to him. 

“Myne, get a grip. You gotta start at the front of the group since you walk so 
slow, remember?” 

“Right, sorry.” 

The platoon of kids, myself included, walked on and passed through the gate. 
What was normally a grassy wonderland had been scarred deeply by the storm, 


with mud scattered everywhere. Um... Does this world have financial assistance 
for natural disasters? 

I kept moving, looking around me in a dazed surprise, when something 
suddenly got in the way of my eyes. Surprised, I looked to the side and saw that 
Lutz was waving his hands in front of my face. 

“Wha? Is something up?” 

“Nah, I was just wondering if you were actually awake. Hey... Myne. Are you 
gonna make those, uh, (clay tablets) again? What are they, anyway?” 

Even if I wasn’t writing in Japanese, Lutz was illiterate. He had no idea what 
I was writing. Not to mention that his daily life involved no paper or writing 
whatsoever. There wasn’t a single letter written anywhere in his home. He no 
doubt knew nothing of the splendor of media in general, with clay tablets just 
one of the mediums of recording information he had never encountered in his 
life. 

I began to teach Lutz, feeling an odd sense of responsibility to proselytize 
books and writing. “Well, it’s simple. They’re things to write on. Like, if you 
have something you don’t want to forget, you can write it down on them. That 
way you can’t forget it, right? If you store the tablet properly, you can look at it 
whenever you want. That’s what (clay tablets) are for. They’re just one (medium 
of recording information) out of many. Clay is so squishy that you can just use a 
finger to wipe away mistakes, and once you’re done, you can harden them with 
fire. Don’t you think that’s amazing?” 

Maybe due to how I had said that all without pausing, Lutz just tilted his head 
a bit, mouth hanging open. “...Ya lost me. Anyway, what’d you write down?” 

“I wrote a story. One my mom told me. Like, I won’t forget it if I write it 
down, you know? What I really want are books, but there aren’t any here. So I’ll 
just have to make them myself.” 

“Hmmm. So that’s what you really wanna do, Myne?” 

I thought about Lutz’s question and suddenly realized something. I had been 
thinking for a long time that I wanted to make books, since they were too 
expensive for my poor family to own, but what I really wanted deep inside 
wasn’t to make books. 

“Mmm, not quite. What I really want is to live a life surrounded by books. I 
want tons and tons of new books to be made every month, I want to buy all of 
them, and I want to spend my life reading them.” 

“Uuuh, so basically, you want books...?” 

“Yes! I want them right now, so bad. But they’re too expensive to buy.
