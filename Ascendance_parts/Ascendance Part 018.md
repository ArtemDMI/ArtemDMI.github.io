Benno put down his cup, looked up at the ceiling, and let out a slow sigh. 
“Yeah. Her hair was the color of the night, so silky that light gleamed off it. Her 
skin was pure white with not a speck of dirt to be found. Her hands were smooth 
like those of a noble who knows nothing of labor or household chores. Even her 
teeth were white. Everything about her conflicted with her raggedy clothing. No 
matter how I look at it, things don’t add up.” 

“Hair so silky that light gleams off of it, you say?! What does she do to make 
it like that?!” 


“Wha? Corinna, you’re plenty pretty already.” 

“Quiet, Otto. I’m asking my brother.” 

Otto blinked in surprise at just how serious she was. Women really did care 
quite a lot about how silky their hair was. Corinna rarely showed this much 
interest in anything but sewing. 

“Seems like she’s putting something on it, but she wouldn’t tell me what.” 
Benno’s answer led Corinna to look at Otto, eyes full of hope. 

“Would she tell you, Otto?” 

“...She’s probably on her guard now. I don’t think she’ll tell me.” Otto 
nonetheless resolved to ask Myne the next time he saw her, for the sake of his 
wife who wanted to know the secret to silky hair. He was a man who would do 
anything for his beloved. 

Otto continued, “Well, besides her hair, she’s got clean hands since she’s too 
small and weak to help around the house much. Her skin’s probably so white 
because she’s bedridden with fevers all the time and doesn’t go outside in the 
sun much.” 

“...Now that you mention it, our meeting originally got postponed because 
she got sick,” murmured Benno to himself. Otto nodded with a frown, 
remembering how much of a pain it had been to deal with how on edge the 
captain had gotten after five days of Myne’s fever staying strong. 

“If Myne looks the way she does due to being sick, should you two really be 
calling her abnormal?” Corinna determined from their conversation that Myne 
wasn’t a big deal. She shrugged as if having lost interest, but Benno shook his 
head. 

“No, it’s not just her looks. What really got to me was her attitude and tone. 
She carried herself in a way only those trained to do so would. This is a stretch, 
but her parents aren’t fallen nobles who are strict with their parenting, are they?” 

“The captain’s got another daughter, and she’s normal. She’s got silky hair 
too and relatively clean skin, but that’s all. She doesn’t stick out like Myne 
does.” 

Benno nodded at Otto’s explanation and looked Corinna head-on. “Corinna, 
there was a lot more off about that girl than her looks. She had enough guts to 
not look away when I glared at her, the smarts to hide the details of her hair from 
me and turn things in her favor, the courage to gamble on making a prototype 
with a deadline, the negotiation skills to add conditions to her terms... Nothing 
about her was like a kid that hasn’t even been baptized yet.” 

“There exists a child that didn’t look away after you glared at them?! That 


girl is certainly odd, no doubt about it!” exclaimed Corinna, her eyes wide. 
Benno was the oldest child of the family and Corinna the youngest, so when 
their father died not long after her birth, Benno had taken his place in many 
ways. She had grown up being scolded harshly by Benno and thus knew very 
well how terrifying his glare could be. 

“Aaaah, y’know, she’s got a great memory and mind for math too. I couldn’t 
believe it when I gave her that slate. She knew how to hold the pen and use it 
without any instruction at all. Almost like she already knew how to write, 
somehow.” 

“Perhaps she learned from watching you?” suggested Corinna as she poured 
Otto more wine, having noticed that his cup was empty. 

Otto took a sip while thinking about how to word his response. “Well, I did 
show her how I did it, but it’s not so simple to write without hands on practice. 
You could explain how to hold a pen to a kid for a hundred years and they’d still 
struggle to draw lines at first. Letters, all the more so.” 

“You do have a point...” Corinna knew from teaching her own apprentices 
that verbal explanations alone were not enough for children to learn. 

“Myne’s math skills are bizarre too. She said her mom taught her numbers at 
the market, but knowing your numbers doesn’t mean you know how to do math, 
yeah?” 

“Hold on,” Benno said. “The apprentices at my place know how to do a little 
math. They learn it from spending time with their parents.” Most apprentice 
merchants were the children of merchants, so many of them knew how to read, 
write, and do math on some level by the time their baptism came around. Otto 
himself had learned to read and do math while traveling the world with his 
merchant parents. But the math Myne could do was on an entirely different level. 

“Myne knows a lot more than a little math. Budget reports involve 
calculating the stock and price of all the stuff we use at the south gate, yeah? The 
numbers get a lot bigger than the small ones at the market. Multiple digits larger. 
But she can calculate them without issue, like it’s the most natural thing in the 
world. And she doesn’t even use a calculator. She just writes the numbers next to 
each other on the slate.” 

“...I knew it, you have been making her work as your assistant. How could 
you make a little kid like that help with budget reports? Shameful.” 

Otto, glaring at Benno’s amused grin, lowered his voice. “I’ve never said this 
to anyone, but listen. She’s doing most of my paperwork for me. Seventy 
percent, at least.” 


“...Wha?!” 

“...Seventy percent? Dear...” 

Both of them were shocked. Benno briefly froze, eyes opened wide in shock, 
and Corinna wasn’t much different. 

Otto couldn’t help but laugh. “If she knew how to read more words she’d be 
doing it all. She’s something else. One time, I was away at a meeting, and she 
dealt with a noble’s letter of introduction perfectly.” 

That incident really surprised him. Otto had received Myne’s report after the 
meeting. She told him that a merchant with a letter of introduction from a 
laynoble was waiting. Normally, visitors with letters from a noble introducing 
them to another noble are given the highest priority, and their needs were 
accommodated to immediately so that they could be sent to the castle gates as 
soon as possible. Even commoners are treated like laynobles. 

On that day, however, a meeting was being held by an archnoble. It was 
obvious that the archnoble should be prioritized. But one mistake in treatment 
and the visitor could potentially get furious enough that they’d use their letter of 
introduction as a shield to force their way into the meeting, which would earn 
the ire of the archnoble and spiral out of control. 

The situation was complex, and in the midst of that complexity Myne 
exploited the commoner merchant’s pride by sending them to the waiting room 
for laynobles, and framed the situation in an agreeable way by telling them that 
an archnoble’s meeting is underway. To top things off, she gave a report on the 
situation as soon as the meeting ended, which deftly avoided a situation where 
the commander left before giving the proper signature. The situation was 
resolved quickly and in such a way that the commander could reprimand the 
confused soldier for relying on a child for help. It was perfect. 

“She must be amazing, then.” 

“Amazing’s one way to put it, but it’s more like... she’s abnormal. 
Something’s weird about her. But I don’t think her dad, the captain, has noticed 
that at all. He treats her just like he would any cute and sickly daughter. If I 
hadn’t said I wanted to make her my assistant, he probably never would have 
noticed how intelligent she is.” 

“Good for her that she’s got thick parents. If they had noticed, they might’ve 
thrown her out for being a freak,” said Benno, making Corinna furrow her 
brows. 

“Don’t even joke about that. I don’t want to imagine it.” 

“Don’t worry, Corinna. Even if her parents threw her out, Benno would pick 


her up. She’s skilled enough to fight Benno and win,” said Otto with a grin. 
Corinna giggled. 

“...Hey, Otto. Do you think that girl’s really gonna make the stuff?” Benno 
gave Otto a hard look while drumming his fingers on the table. His reddish- 
brown eyes had become those of a merchant probing the future for profit. 

“The paper that’s not parchment made from animal skin? Yeah, she’ll make 
it. No doubt about it.” 

“You seem pretty confident in her.” 

“Not long ago I gave her the idea that if she can’t do something herself, she 
should make someone else do it. Now that Lutz has become her arms and legs, 
she’s got nothing to fear.” 

Myne had been frustrated with her weakness above all else, which was a 
clear sign that she knew the method for making paper and just couldn’t execute 
it herself. She had said she would make prototypes precisely because she knew 
she could do it. Otto didn’t think she had been gambling at all. 

“...Paper like that will turn the market upside down. I wonder how I should 
deal with her.” 

“Woah now, are you thinking about hiring Myne?” Otto, sensing from 
Benno’s words that he intended to take not just Lutz but Myne too as 
apprentices, opened his eyes wide in surprise. 

“Of course! You think I’m gonna let someone else have her?! Do you have 
any idea how many products that girl will invent all on her own? That hair stick, 
that stuff that makes hair gleam, the paper that’s not parchment... Those are all 
the inventions I learned about today, but she’s definitely hiding more. She’s 
going to become a living natural disaster that destroys the market and remakes it 
anew.” 

“Hold up! She’s my assistant. I’m not gonna let you take her from me.” 
Benno was completely right, but Otto wasn’t having any of it. He had spent the 
past half-year training her specifically so she could help him during budget 
season. He wouldn’t let someone snatch her away without a fight. 

But Benno just gave a smug laugh and curved his lips into a grin. “The girl 
said being a merchant was her second choice. She even said she wasn’t 
interested in being your assistant. You’ve only spent half a year on her, right? 
Give it up. Look for someone else.” 


“I’ll never find someone who only needs six months of training to become 
even half as competent as her! If Myne’s just doing the thinking and Lutz is 
doing all the making, what’s the problem with her working at the gate?!” 

At the very least, he wouldn’t budge on having her help for budget season. Or 
so he thought, glaring as hard as he could, but it was Benno who wouldn’t budge 
an inch. He put his cup down and leaned forward. 

“No! I’m going to get a contract with her at the Merchant’s Guild. I won’t 
risk letting anyone else take her.” 

“Myne doesn’t have what it takes to survive in the Merchant’s Guild! She’s 
so weak and sickly you would hardly believe it. Any work that involves moving 
around is too much for her!” 

“...Is she really that sick?” Benno was so stunned he lost his momentum, 
which Otto took as an opportunity. He drove his point home. 

“I figured she would be fine in a room with a furnace and left her on her own 
for a single bell’s worth of time, but when I came back, she was collapsed and 
sick with a fever.” 

“What?” 

Otto had needed to stand by the gate when on guard duty, so he left Myne in 
a furnace-warmed room for a bit, but when he came back to check on her, she 
was collapsed with a burning-hot forehead. When Gunther came to get her, he 
said, “Don’t sweat it. This happens all the time.” Otto could imagine that meant 
that Myne’s abnormal weakness was accepted by her family as a fact of life. 

“Things were horrible back when spring just began. She couldn’t even walk 
from her home to the gate.” 

“Oh? But I don’t believe it should be that long of a walk to the gate from any 
home in the city, dear.” Since the outer walls circled around the city in its 
entirety, it wasn’t actually that big of a city. A kid should be able to walk from 
the west gate to the east gate within the time span of a single bell ring. 

“That’s right. The captain’s house isn’t too far from the southern gate. But 
she couldn’t manage it. She’d get exhausted halfway through, get carried the rest 
of the way, and then rest immobile in the night shift room. After that, she’d be 
bedridden for two or three days every time.” 

“Hey, isn’t that, uh, dangerous? Wouldn’t she just die if someone put her to 
work?” 

That was a legitimate concern. In particular, Benno’s store was growing in 
size and was as busy as it was successful. Otto didn’t expect that Myne would be 
capable of working there with her sickly body. 


“Ngh...” Benno had been told that she was sickly, but he must not have 
expected that she was that sickly. He rubbed his temples and fell into thought. 

With that topic settled, Corinna stood up to prepare lunch. On the table was a 
lamp, a small jug for refilling cups, and a plate with dried meat piled on top for 
snacks. Otto, chewing hard on the salty dried meat, watched Benno pour himself 
a fresh glass. 

“Hey, Benno. You sure you don’t know anything about that sickness Myne 
mentioned? The one with the heat inside of her?” Otto figured from the reaction 
Benno had to Myne’s question that he actually knew what the sickness was, and 
that was correct. 

Benno looked up a little, wondering whether or not he should say it. After 
some thought, he let out a quiet murmur, which was rare for him. “I figured she 
might have the devouring. But I can’t say for sure. Not enough evidence.” 

“...The devouring? What kinda disease is that?” 

“It’s not a disease. It’s when the mana inside of you grows too much and eats 
you alive from the inside out.” 

Otto’s eyes shot wide open in surprise. Mana was a mysterious, powerful 
energy that commoners didn’t have. He didn’t see it that often and thus didn’t 
know too much about it, but as far as he knew, it was said that no country would 
be able to survive without the assistance of mana. Which is why nobles, 
possessing mana as they did, stood above commoners and led countries. 

“...It’s rare, but sometimes those who aren’t nobles end up having mana too. 
But magic tools needed to unleash mana are incredibly expensive, so it’s true 
that only nobles are capable of properly using mana.” Benno, given his market 
connections to nobles, knew more about this country’s inner workings than Otto 
did. 

“I can’t say for sure, but if that girl has the devouring, it would explain both 
her sickly nature and small size. The thing is, though, if this really is the 
devouring we’re dealing with here, then without a magic tool it won’t be long 
before that girl... dies.” 

“Wha?!” Otto, with thoughts of Gunther doting on Myne passing his mind, 
locked his eyes on Benno as if he’d been hit with a bucket of cold water. But 
Benno’s expression was serious, and Otto could tell he wasn’t joking around. 

“The mana in her will grow as she does, and eat her alive in the process. 
Commoners with mana generally don’t survive until their baptism without a 
magic tool.” 

“Is there something we can do?” asked Otto desperately. Maybe Benno 


would know a solution to the problem. 

Benno sighed and scratched his head. “She can avoid dying if she signs a 
contract with a noble. They’ll lend her magic tools. However... that’d be signing 
her life away. She’d become living furniture that exists just to use her power for 
nobles. Hard to say whether dying young with her family would be better or 
worse than that.” 

Benno’s words provided no easy out. Otto himself couldn’t tell which would 
be better. He didn’t want to die, but he didn’t want to live a life serving nobles 
like cattle, either. 

“Otto, don’t get too serious. We don’t know if she really does have the 
devouring yet,” said Benno. “In the first place, she would already be on the 
verge of death if she really did have it. She wouldn’t be able to walk around 
outside like that.” 

“I see...” Otto’s chest was flooded simultaneously with slight relief and great 
unease. Myne had been on the verge of death multiple times. He heard that she 
was only capable of walking outside due to months of hard work, and that before 
now she had barely gone outside at all. 

Would she really be okay? Should he report this to Gunther? Otto swallowed 
down the whirlwind of feelings within him by taking a gulp of alcohol from his 
cup. 


Extra Story: A Day Without Myne 


“Hey, Lutz. I’m going on ahead.” 

“Got it. I’ll be right behind ya, Ralph!” 

Upon hearing that my brother Ralph was on his way out, I hurriedly wrapped 
my ham and bread before stuffing it into my basket along with my hunting tools. 
Then I hitched the basket on my back and dashed out of my house. 

Ralph didn’t have to go to the forest with everyone else anymore, since he 
was baptized and working every other day. But now he could go to the forest 
whenever he wanted, which meant he generally went with friends from work. I 
didn’t get to go to the forest with him often anymore, so I felt a little excited as I 
ran down the steps. 

“Oof, guess today’s gonna get pretty hot.” As I headed to the group of kids 
who were waiting to go to the forest, I felt the changing of the seasons through 
the heat of the sunlight hitting my skin. 

I could see Fey and Tuuli at the meeting place too. Despite also being 
baptized, they were going to the forest with the little kids today. Seeing all three 
of them together here made me feel nostalgic. 

“Ralph, Lutz! Good morning.” Tuuli turned this way and waved after seeing 
us. 

“Morning, Tuuli. How’s Myne? It’s been three whole days, so I’m guessing 
her fever’s going now?” Myne had apparently gotten so exhausted from cutting 
wood and making those mokkan things that she ended up bedridden for days. 

“...No, not at all. It’s been three days since she collapsed in the storage room 
and her fever’s still super high. I’m really worried.” Tuuli, brows furrowed, 
looked down and shook her head. A day or two of being bedridden was normal 
for Myne, but not a high fever lasting three days. She looked sick with worry. 

“She’ll be fine, I’m telling you. Myne hasn’t made a book yet, she won’t die 
that easily.” Myne was weak and sickly, but she was always chasing her dreams 
with all she had. I never understood what she was talking about when she 
brought up books. The explanations just didn’t get through to me. But I did 
know that Myne was doing absolutely everything she could to make them. 
Nothing inspired me to do my best more than seeing her work so hard to get 


what she wanted in her tiny, weak body. 

...Plus, she said she would introduce me to a former traveling merchant. 

Since traveling merchants were always moving between cities, it was hard for 
me to find one that would take me as an apprentice. I heard that Myne’s teacher 
at the gate used to be a traveling merchant, so I asked Myne to introduce me to 
him. Someone like him probably still had connections with current traveling 
merchants. Maybe he could introduce me to one and I could become their 
apprentice. 

When Myne promised to introduce me to him, she said, “I’m helpful to you 
too sometimes, Lutz” and then laughed kinda proudly. 

“I’ve got a promise with Myne, so she’s definitely gonna get better.” 

“You’re right, Lutz. Myne will be okay. Definitely.” Tuuli’s expression 
brightened a little. 

“We’re heading out!” With Ralph’s announcement, the group of about ten 
kids started walking to the forest. 

“We can walk a lot faster without Myne, huh?” 

“Ahaha. Myne really does walk slow. But that’s okay, since you’re always 
helping her.” 

Once the group of kids was past the city walls, Tuuli, being an older girl with 
a strong sense of responsibility, always ended up taking care of everyone. She 
wasn’t able to spend all her time watching over just Myne. 

“Ralph, I’m going with Fey to lead the group. Would you watch over the 
back with Lutz for me?” 

“Yeah! Anyway... Lutz, I’m surprised you bother doing all that,” Ralph 
murmured to me in an exasperated tone of voice after seeing Tuuli walk off. 

I glared at him. “Doing all what?” 

“Taking care of Myne. I can tell just by watching it’s a huge pain in the ass.” 

Ralph was known throughout the neighborhood as a nice guy that takes care 
of others, but he just acted that way in public because he wanted to show off to 
Tuuli. He treated me completely differently when she wasn’t around. 

“I’m glad I’m the same age as Tuuli.” 

His tone was pretty heartfelt, but I just shrugged. I was taking care of Myne 
partially for my own benefit, so it wasn’t a big deal. Nobody else seemed to 
know this but me, but Myne knew all sorts of weird stories, and she knew how to 
write. She could even introduce me to a traveling merchant. 

“Myne’s good in her own ways,” I said, almost reflexively. Ralph peered 
toward me, eyes full of interest. 


“Like how?” 

The first thing that came to mind was the stuff about the traveling merchant, 
but I didn’t want to talk about that. Ralph and my other older brothers always 
laughed and called me stupid when I said I wanted to become a traveling 
merchant. I wanted to become one in secret and surprise my whole family. 

“Myne shares her food with me and teaches me good recipes, so yeah.” 

“All you care about is food, huh?” Ralph laughed, but food really was the 
biggest reason why I was so serious about watching over Myne. Spending time 
with her meant more food for me. And if I helped her, I could eat really tasty 
food. 

“What’re you getting smug about? You eat that food too.” 

“Yeah, cause it tastes good and I help make it. Why wouldn’t I eat it?” My 
older brothers generally stole my food, so I filled myself up by eating nuts and 
fruits while gathering. Winter was the worst, since I couldn’t go gathering. No 
gathering meant no fmit, and since the blizzards kept us locked in all the time, 
food was more scarce than other seasons. 

The parue cakes that Myne thought up one day to help fill my stomach over 
winter were simple to make, using mainly the parue leftovers we normally left 
for birds. You could make tons of them no sweat, and they were so good I still 
couldn’t believe it. 

...And best of all, since everyone got their own plates with their own parue 
cakes, I didn’t have to worry about my brothers stealing them from me! 

That day marked the beginning of Myne teaching us delicious recipes each 
sunny day we gathered parues. If I followed Myne’s instructions, I would get 
lots of tasty food. The moment I realized that, I promised her that I would help 
her and be the strength she didn’t have. In return, I would get to eat a lot of food. 
I would work as hard as it took to get tasty food. 

“Okay, we’re meeting back here once fifth bell rings. Alright?” 

“Okaaay!” 

We settled on a meeting place upon reaching the forest and then let the kids 
scatter to do their gathering. Since Ralph and Fey were here today, I was going 
hunting. 

“Should be about shumil season now. I’m bettin’ there’s tons of them running 
around here.” Ralph grinned, holding onto a net. 

Shumils were small feybeasts that even kids like us could hunt. They were 
about as tall as my knees and were useful for their meat, pelt, bones, feathers, 
and fat. Their meat was especially soft and delicious compared to other things 


we could hunt. Since shumils loved to eat rutrebs, a summer fruit, their meat got 
even better as they grew in number over the summer. 

When hunting shumils, you wanted to split into groups. One to chase the 
prey, one to lie in wait with a net. 

“Me and Lutz will chase’m. Tuuli and Ralph, keep the net ready,” said Fey, 
name unrelated to feybeasts, as he began discussing a plan to catch the shumils 
with us. There was a smallish hill deeper into the forest, and since shumils had a 
tendency to run to high places to escape predators, the best thing to do was chase 
them up and into a prepared net. 

After seeing Ralph and Tuuli go up to the arranged location with the net, Fey 
and I picked up stones and started searching for shumils close together. If we 
could find a patch of rutrebs, we could expect to find shumils nearby. Hunting 
shumils was important to stop them from eating our share of the rutrebs.
