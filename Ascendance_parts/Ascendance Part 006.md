Umm, no, of course not. What the heck’s going on? I rubbed my sleepy eyes 
and glared at Dad, but Mom and Tuuli both nodded enthusiastically with big 
happy smiles. I was the only one not understanding. 

“Oh, right. Myne was sick when this was decided, so she might not have 
heard about it.” Mom clapped her hands together and both Tuuli and Dad 
nodded in agreement. It felt like I was being left out and excluded from the rest 
of the family, which didn’t feel great. 

I pouted a little, cheeks puffing out, but everyone started preparing 
immediately. They didn’t seem to have the time to worry about me. 

“Anyway, we need to keep warm. I remember you getting a fever last year, 
Myne!” Mom called out to me while carrying stuff down the steps. I was in the 
middle of changing clothes since, given that they wouldn’t let me stay home 
alone, I had no choice but to go along with them. 

...Why are we going to a farm in a far-off village, anyway? I had intended to 
walk at least part of the way to the village in order to build up strength, but I was 
so excessively slow that Dad got frustrated and put me in the wagon. There 
really wasn’t any space for me, so I huddled into as small of a ball as possible. 

In the wagon there were several barrels of varying size, plenty of empty 
bottles, string, cloth, salt, and wood. It was all important stuff for what we were 
doing at the farm, probably. ...Wait. Am I the most useless thing in this wagon? 

Dad was pulling the wagon from the front while Mom and Tuuli pushed it 
from the back. It kinda felt like I was being serious dead weight, which again 


made me feel bad. 

“Um, Mom. Why are we going to a farm?” 

“There’s no smokery in the city, remember? We’re going to rent the one in 
the nearest farming village.” 

We’re going to smoke meat? That reminds me, we bought lots of meat at the 
market. 

But I feel like she already boiled or salted most of it. There’s that much left? 
Shouldn’t it be bad by now? Is this okay? 

I started counting the days on my fingers, worried, but Mom just looked at 
me with exasperation. 

“What are you even talking about? Today’s pig day. We’ll buy two pigs at the 
farm, split into groups to prepare them, and then share the meat.” 

“Wha?” For an instant, my ears blocked what Mom had said. There was a 
brief but clear time lag between me hearing that and the noise reaching my brain, 
and when it did, I started to tremble. “P, P-P-P, Pig day?! What?!” 

“The day when we and our neighbors gather together, butcher a pig, salt it, 
smoke it, and make bacon, sausage, and all other sorts of meat. Goodness Myne, 
don’t you remember last ye... ah, actually, you got a fever in the cart on the way 
there.” 

Honestly, I want to get a fever this year too. At least then I won’t have to 
watch it happen. 

“Mom, didn’t you buy a lot of meat at the market a bit ago...?” 

“You should know that wouldn’t be enough. In fact, that was just extra meat 
to supplement the pigs.” 

I had thought she bought more than enough meat before, but apparently it 
was all just extra meat, not even the main event. I couldn’t even imagine just 
how much meat was necessary to last the winter. 

In sharp contrast to my depression over being unable to avoid seeing pigs get 
butchered, Tuuli was wearing a bright, full smile as she pushed the cart. “There’s 
lots of fun stuff about today. We get to taste the meat in the middle of it and 
there’s fresh sausage for dinner, it’s great. This is the first time you’ll be helping, 
Myne, but it’s kind of like a festival everyone gets excited for. I’m glad we get to 
go together this year!” 

“Everyone?” I blinked in confusion, and Mom replied with an expression that 
practically said “Don ’t ask questions with such obvious answers. ” 

“Who would we do it with if not our neighbors? Butchering pigs is a serious 
job, it can’t be done without at least ten adults.” 


Eugh, our neighbors... Myne had a lot of vague memories, so there were 
definitely going to be a bunch of people who knew me that I didn’t know. Not 
only would dealing with them be a pain, but we were going to be butchering a 
pig on top of that. Just remembering what I saw at the market was enough to 
make a chill run down my back. 

“...I don’t want to go.” 

“What’re you talking about? We won’t have any sausage or bacon all winter 
if we don’t go.” 

We needed the meat for the winter, so naturally they wouldn’t turn around 
even if I said I didn’t want to go. I had to participate no matter how little I 
wanted to. I sighed, depressed, and soon our cart reached the southern gate of the 
outer wall. 

“Wait, Captain? Aren’t you late? Everyone else passed through a long time 
ago.” 

“Yeah, I figured.” 

One of Dad’s coworkers called out to him as we passed through the gate. 
Apparently, our neighbors had left for the farm a long time ago. 

“Stay safe.” A younger looking guy who looked like he probably liked 
children waved at me, so I waved back. Polite decency was important in all 
things. 

“Wooow...” The moment our cart rumbled out of the small tunnel that was 
the southern gate, I let out a tiny cry of surprise. It was the first time I had left 
the city walls since becoming Myne. To be honest, I hadn’t expected things to be 
so different outside. 

First of all, there were no buildings. Inside the city was a tight, never-ending 
cluster of buildings, but the second we got outside of the gates, there was a wide 
road with only about ten to fifteen shacks strewn about. 

On top of that, the air was nice. The more open the air the more the smell of 
waste was diluted, I supposed, and for the first time in a long while I 
remembered that air could taste good. There were no tall walls to block all the 
smells inside. I looked around and saw a field of crops on one side of me and a 
forest of tall trees on the other. The scenery was impossibly tranquil, the very 
definition of idyllic. 

“Myne, close your mouth. You’re gonna bite your tongue off.” 

“Bwuh? ! ” 

Right after Dad’s warning, the cart began rattling up and down even worse 


than it did in town. The city road had shifted from cobblestone to a normal dirt 
road with mounds and hills. It was shaking so hard I thought all our stuff would 
fall out, but at least they had ropes holding them down. I was in the most danger 
of all since I wasn’t locked down whatsoever. I clung tightly to the side of the 
cart for my own safety. 

...This kind of road is the worst! On sunny days they’re super bumpy and on 
rainy day’s they’re a muddy mess! Learn how to make asphalt already! I spat 
angry complaints on the inside and soon felt Dad speed up. 

We had arrived at the village. It was about fifteen minutes away from the 
town gate, and after passing through the entryway, I could hear lots of people 
talking. 

“Almost there.” 

Butchering the pig was mainly a job for men. They had to hold down beasts 
that looked like they weighed over a hundred kilograms, not to mention tie them 
up and hang them from their feet. It was a job that took a lot of strength. 

While they were doing that, the women would prepare the smokery, boil lots 
of water, and prepare salt and tools for preservation. 

By the time we reached the village, the butchering was already beginning. 
Those who didn’t participate naturally didn’t get any meat. 

“Crap! It’s starting! Effa, Tuuli, hurry and take your places!” 

“Oh no! Run, Tuuli!” 

“Right!” 

All three of them let go of the cart, grabbed wax-coated aprons made from 
some thick material, and put them on. Once Mom and Tuuli got theirs on, they 
mshed over to the smokery where a bunch of women already were. Dad put on 
his apron too and ran off after grabbing a spear, which was probably an 
important tool here. 

Wh... Everyone’s so fast! My family had all ran off before I could even 
process what was happening. I could have run after Mom, but I wouldn’t want to 
be standing around in a crowd with no idea of what to do. 

It was a yearly ritual for these people, so there were probably a ton of 
unspoken rules. If only I had a manual. 

Knowing that I just got in the way no matter what I did, I decided to wait in 
the cart until someone called for me. This is important work too, I told myself 
while sitting on top of the abandoned cart doing nothing in particular. 

Unfortunately, however, Dad had left the cart right in the middle of the pig¬ 
slaughtering field. There was a little distance between us, but I could clearly see 


the pig squealing in pain and fear while running away from its pursuers. There 
was a wooden stake driven into the ground, connected by rope to the pig’s right 
hind leg. It fled in a circle around the stake while men chased after it, desperate 
to pin it down. 

I saw a familiar pink head in the crowd. Ralph and Lutz were definitely 
around here somewhere. 

“Go get’m! Hyaaah!” Screaming out battle cries, Dad participated in the 
chase. He readied the spear with immense speed and then stabbed it right into 
the pig. That single strike was enough for the pig to start convulsing, legs 
twitching, before it stopped moving entirely. 

I let out a tiny shriek, but all the men let out a cheer at what had been done. 
Mom rushed forward with a metal bucket-looking thing and a somewhat long 
stick. Another woman brought a bowl thing to the pig. A moment later, blood 
sprayed everywhere, dyeing several people’s aprons dark red. Dad had probably 
pulled the spear out after the blood-gathering bucket and bowl were prepared. 

I held down my mouth and felt myself shake with terror. I couldn’t see the 
pig due to all the women’s aprons crowding around, but I could see how 
mechanically the woman was gathering blood in the bowl and pouring it into the 
bucket. 

Mom furrowed her brows a little while firmly stirring all the blood being 
poured into her bucket. Ngh... Mom looks really scary right now. 

Afterward, a bunch of people worked together to hang the pig upside down 
from a tree that had been prepared beforehand. The blood they hadn’t managed 
to squeeze out of the pig began dripping down to the ground. 

The real butchering was about to begin. A man with a thick butcher’s knife 
walked up and pressed it against the pig’s stomach. 

That was the last thing I remembered. Before I knew it, I was in a stone 
building, not one I had seen in the village. I could see the ceiling since someone 
had laid me onto my back, but it wasn’t my home’s ceiling. 

I blinked several times, still on my back, and then remembered what I had 
seen before passing out. It made me feel sick. But for some reason, something 
felt really familiar about the pig being butchered. 

What was it... Like, something being hung upside down, and then being cut 
apart... It was on the tip of my tongue, but it just wouldn’t come out. If I had to 
guess, it wasn’t one of Myne’s memories. It was one of my Urano memories. I 
must have seen something similar in Japan. 


...Ah! It looked like that fish I saw being hung upside down in a coastal 
Ibaraki market! From that perspective, I could understand why everyone was so 
excited about the pig. I remembered how excited people were to eat a fish that 
fresh. Well... I can understand, but it’s still a bit emotionally rough for me. I 
mean, the fish didn’t scream in pain like that. It didn’t gush out blood. Guuuh, so 
gross... 

I rolled over, holding my mouth, and fell right off what I was lying on. 

“Oooow...” I used my hands to stand up and look around, seeing immediately 
that I had been resting on a smallish wooden bench. There was a burning 
fireplace nearby, so it wasn’t cold. But nobody was around, and I couldn’t hear 
anybody talking. 

Oh right... Where am I, anyway? The moment I decided I needed to figure 
out where I was, a soldier peeked into the room, maybe due to having heard me 
fall. 

“Oh. Finally awake, huh?” 

“Mr. Otto?” I let out a sigh of relief, glad to see someone I knew. 

A stone building with Otto inside could only mean that I was in one of the 
gate’s waiting rooms. My anxiety melted away after I learned where I was. 

“That means you remember me, right?” Otto looked visibly relieved that I 
remembered him. That made sense. I was a child on the outside, after all. He 
definitely thought that I would have started crying if I saw someone I didn’t 
know. 

“I could never forget you.” I mean, you’re the first man of culture I’ve met in 
this world and my (future) teacher. How could I forget? 

I mimicked the chest-tapping salute, to which Otto laughed a little and 
mbbed my head. “The captain rushed back here with you in tow. He said you 
collapsed in the cart. He’ll be back as soon as he’s finished with what he needs 
to do.” 

I didn’t know how long it would take to butcher a pig, but they had to prepare 
the meat afterward too, so I couldn’t imagine it would be over soon. 

Hm... Thinking about it, Tuuli said we would get fresh meat for dinner. Guess 
I’ll be waiting here for a while. Knowing that I would end up with plenty of 
spare time, I had put the materials I needed for faux-papyrus into the cart, but 
they were out of my reach. 

“What’s wrong, Myne? Feeling lonely without your mom and dad?” 

“No, I was just thinking about how I could kill some time.” I shook my head 
and said what I was really thinking. 


Otto looked at me hard for a bit, then whispered, “He did say she wasn’t as 
young as she looked,” and nodded to himself. “I might have something that can 
help, Myne. How about this?” 

“Wow! The slate!” 

Otto held out the slate. He knew for sure we’d be passing by the gate today, 
so he had brought it with him to give to me. 

A man of culture that considerate about other people?! Mr. Otto’s such a 
great person! 

“I need to go back and stand at the gate, but go ahead and practice this while 
I’m gone.” 

Otto wrote my name, Myne, at the top of the slate before setting down the 
slate pen and a cloth. He then left the room. 

I hugged the slate with one arm and waved Otto goodbye with the biggest 
smile of my life before dropping my gaze back down to the slate. 

The best way to explain it was to call it a mini-chalkboard about the size of 
an A4 piece of paper. A dark, thin stone set into a wooden frame. Both sides 
could be written on, and one of them had lines for practicing letters on. 

The slate pen was a writing tool specifically for slates, and although I could 
tell it was a thin stone from a touch, it looked entirely like a thin piece of chalk. 
The somewhat dirty cloth was a way to clear off the slate. It would probably do a 
good job, given how the letters Otto wrote got a little blurry just from me 
hugging the slate. 

“Aaah, my heart’s beating so fast!” I put the slate onto the table and held the 
pen. Just gripping the slate pen like a pencil made my heart race. 

I started off by copying Otto’s letters, none of which I recognized at all. I was 
so nervous writing the first letters of my second life that they all ended up 
twisted and shaky. If I were in Japan, I likely would have shaken my head and 
wiped them away immediately to try again. But it had been so long since I had 
seen letters that I couldn’t take my eyes off them. I was so happy. 


I took a deep breath, exhaled, wiped the letters away with the cloth next to 
the slate, and tried again. Things went a lot better the second time. I wrote my 
name, erased it, wrote it, erased it... 

When I got bored of that, I wrote little poems and song lyrics in Japanese, 
then erased them, then wrote them, then erased them... 

Haaah... This is bliss. 

I never would've thought that writing letters could make me so happy. 

Despite being near the furnace, the waiting room was so drafty that after 
spending hours playing with the slate and waiting for my family, I caught a cold 
in record time and ended up in bed with a fever. 

“You still have a fever, Myne, so stay in bed. No getting out!” 

“...Okay.” 

My parents busily walked around, in and out of the house, as they carried 
root vegetables into the winter storeroom. Tuuli was in the kitchen making jam 
out of fruit and honey that she had gathered herself. In this world, all it took was 
a sweet scent drifting through my home to make me happy. 

While they were in the middle of stashing away beer and the prepared pig, 
Tuuli brought me my soup lunch. I put aside my stone slate and took the whole 
tray from her. 

“Sorry, Tuuli.” 

“Seriously. This is a real pain.” 

“Aww, what? Didn’t you promise not to say that?” 

“I never promised that!” 

I mean... Okay, you didn’t promise that. But isn’t it still like, an unspoken 
promise? 

While everyone else was exhausting themselves preparing for winter, I was 
lying in bed and playing around with the slate Otto gave me, practicing my name 
and having fun writing in Japanese. 

But I really wanted a book that would preserve writing permanently. If 
writing some letters was all it took to get me this happy, I figured reading a book 
would make me absolutely ecstatic. I needed to hurry up and get healthy again 
so I could make paper. 


Beaten by Ancient Egyptians 


Tiny bits of snow began to fall here and there right as we were on the verge 
of finishing our preparations. Winter was coming, for real. 

During winter, our neighborhood would end up snowed in, and we’d 
generally spend all our time inside the house outside of especially sunny days. I 
normally spent all my time inside anyway like the shut-in I was, so that wasn’t 
really a problem for me. 

But there were no books in this world. Will I survive as a shut-in without any 
books around me ? 

Blizzards often occurred when snow began falling, so we needed to keep our 
windows and doors shut tight for warmth. We then stuffed somewhat thick rags 
into any cracks to block as much wind as possible. 

“...Ngh, so dark.” 

“It’s a blizzard, what did you expect?” 

It caught me off guard that the only sources of light in our locked-up house 
were the furnace and our candles. It was the first time I had ever been inside a 
completely dark room in the middle of the day. It hurt to live without electricity. 
Even back in my Urano days, I had my phone and flashlights when typhoons 
knocked out the power, and usually it got fixed by the next day. Won ’t we all get 
depressed spending weeks in the dark like this? 

“Hey, Mom. Is everyone’s house this dark?” 

“Hmm. I believe those with a decent amount of spare money tend to have 
several lamps around their homes to light things up, but we only have one.” 

“Wha? We have a lamp and we aren’t using it?” I figured that it was best to 
use any light source we had, but Mom just sighed and shook her head. 

“We try to avoid using the lamp since we need to be frugal with oil. You 
wouldn’t want to run out of candles if the winter drags on, would you?” 

There was no argument against being frugal. Even my mom back in Japan 
did all sorts of things in the name of saving money. She would unplug the TV 
from the wall to save on the electricity bill, and yet fall asleep with it still on. 
She’d cut off the water when brushing her teeth to save on water, but leave it on 
when washing dishes. In other words, my mom taught me the importance of self- 


satisfaction. 

I decided to take after my mother’s frugal ways and see if I could finagle a 
way to get the room a little brighter. 

“What’re you doing, Myne?” 

“I think this might make the room a little brighter...” 

With a three-sided mirror’s magnification properties in mind, I polished my 
dad’s old metal gauntlets that he had apparently used in a past war and lined 
them next to the candle. 

“Stop it, Myne.” 

“It’s harder to see now.” 

They both immediately shot me down. Unfortunately, the gauntlets weren’t 
flat slabs of metal, and the surface wasn’t exactly the smoothest. The light 
reflected in all sorts of directions and shined in their eyes, making it harder to 
see their hands. 

“Bwuh, it didn’t work. I wonder if there’s something else I can use like a 
(mirror)...” 

“I would appreciate it if you would stop wasting our time.” Mom shot me 
down with a firm tone, so I gave up on my light-reflecting strategy. 

But still, having diminished eyesight didn’t feel that great regardless of 
whether or not I had any books to read, so I took up camp right next to the warm 
furnace. 

Not long after that, Mom began setting up her loom near me. It wasn’t a large 
machine like those I had seen in Japan. It was something a lot more fundamental. 
I had been wondering how one could weave cloth in a house this small, but it 
seemed there were looms small enough to do the job. 

“Tuuli, since your baptism’s coming up, there’s a lot I need to teach you,” 
said Mom before beginning to teach Tuuli all she needed to know about 
weaving. Tuuli took a spool of thread in hand, looking deadly serious. 

“You put the thread here, then prepare the weft. You weave the thread like 
this...” Using the thread she had dyed in the fall for this purpose, she started 
weaving the cloth. 

She wove the cloth, sewed it into clothing, and embroidered it. While she was 
at it, she prepared next year’s thread from the wool she had bought. We only 
ever bought the base materials. No new clothes were sold where we lived, and 
even cloth was too expensive for most commoners to buy. 

“That’s right, just like that. You’ve got a knack for this, Tuuli. Myne, would 
you like to try too? They say that no beauty doesn’t know how to sew.” 


“Wha? Beauty?” 

“That’s right. Creating clothes for your family is important both practically 
and to show off to the neighbors. You can’t be a true beauty if you’re not good at 
sewing and cooking.” 

Aaah... I’m definitely not gonna grow up into a beauty, then. And I mean, I 
can understand all that being important for a good wife, but what do cooking 
and sewing have to do with being beautiful? 

I was used to clothes just being something you bought at a store. Go to the 
store and you’d be surrounded by clothes with all sorts of varying designs. I 
never was very interested in them, just wearing whatever I thought would get me 
through something without getting yelled at, but even so, my closet ended up 
packed with clothes. 

At the very least, I never wore hand-me-downs that had to be sewed up. 
Sewing was just something I did a few times in school, and those times I just 
used an electrical sewing machine to finish in no time. The best I could do with 
needles was reattach a fallen button.
