I prepared the other parts of the meat while the soup was cooking. I chopped 
the heart, gizzard, and other easily spoiled parts into small chunks and sprinkled 
them with salt and alcohol. These parts were fine to just cook with salt before 
eating. That was, as expected, the method of preparation my family was fastest 
to accept. The word “char-grilling” ran through my head briefly, but I had other 
work to do, so I forgot about it. 

Today we were eating the organs and thigh meat. Mom would be putting her 
all into making something like roast chicken with the thigh meat, so I was 
forbidden from interfering. I salted and rubbed alcohol into the breast meat, then 
put it in the winter storage room. We would be using that for tomorrow’s meal. If 
we had an airtight bag and a fridge, I would have made bird ham, but oh well. 
Life is full of regrets. 

“...That certainly smells good.” 

“It’s not ready yet.” 

Once the smell of the soup started drifting through the air, Mom, who had 
been keeping her distance, started inching her way to the pot. You had to cook 
bird bone broth for a decently long time, so I started chopping vegetables bit by 
bit while keeping an eye on the scum. Doing anything took a long time in this 
body, so I wanted to save time anywhere I could. 

The first step of my plan for making Japanese-like food revolved around the 
concept of a hot pot, where I would cook all the ingredients in a single pot. I had 
figured that once I had good broth, I would be able to make a decent hot pot. I 
wouldn’t be able to make the kind I was used to, but now I had bird bone broth. 
Since I lacked any ponzu sauce, I was taking pomes — the yellow paprika-esque 
fruits that tasted like tomatoes — and boiling them with herbs for flavor in the 
hot pot. In this pome soup I would be using the tips of the bird wings, which 
were too bony for regular eating, and some seasonal vegetable that I didn’t know 
the name of. The fact that most anything tastes good when boiled together is 
why I respect hot pots so much. 


“Oh, I think it’s about ready. Mom, could you help me?” I put a strainer on 
top of the second-biggest pot and called for Mom. 

“What do you need me to do?” 

“I want you to pour the soup out of this pot. It’ll get rid of the stuff inside of 
it that we don’t want.” 

“...So we won’t be eating all that, then,” said Mom, sounding relieved for 
some reason as she strained the chicken bone soup. 

I cleaned the biggest pot and had her put the strained soup into it. We used 
the second biggest pot the most, so it would be a pain to put the soup stock into 
it. My plan was to use the second biggest pot for the pome soup, after all. 

I put dried mushrooms into the prepared soup and got to work starting the 
pome soup. As the wing tips boiled, I loosened the edible meat from the bones 
and added it all to the pot. The bones were sharp, so I had to grab the meat bit by 
bit, making sure not to leave any within. Mom’s roast chicken was starting to 
smell nice, so considering time constraints, I started putting vegetables into my 
pot too. 

“Myne! What do you think you’re doing?!” 

“...Putting in vegetables?” 

“Don’t you know you have to parboil them first?!” 

...That seemed to be normal here, but if you boil vegetables in another pot 
and drain the water before using the vegetables, they’ll taste half as good. A lot 
of the nutrients will melt away, too. I had no complaints with my Mom’s 
cooking, but I didn’t want her to restrain my own cooking with her rules. 

“This is fine for what I’m making.” 

“But you’re just going to ruin your nice meal.” 

“It’ll be okay.” 

The pome soup was done once I took the scum out. A quick taste test 
confirmed that it tasted pretty good. You didn’t have to parboil vegetables before 
using them. 

“I’m home. Aaah, I guess it was our place, huh?” 

“Hi, Tuuli. What do you mean?” 

“I smelled something nice on the road and got hungry while walking. 
Everyone started looking for where the smell was coming from. I didn’t think 
it’d be coming from my place.” It was like getting hungry for noodles after 
walking by a ramen stand. Bird bone broth had a pretty strong smell, after all. 

“I’m home. Oh, huh, now I know where that smell was coming from.” Dad, 


who had a morning shift, came home at about the same time. The bird bone 
broth smell had apparently traveled pretty far. Dad sat at the table with 
excitement on his face; our family had gathered just in time for dinner. 

“A1 gave us a bird for today. He said it was thanks for the meat you gave him 
earlier, Gunther. I made it with Myne.” 

“You’re saying Myne made this stuff I don’t recognize?” 

“That’s right.” 

Mom’s roast was placed in the center of the table, and beside it was salad 
with tenderloin placed on top. The salted organs were placed next to Dad as 
finger food, and pome hot pot was in everyone’s bowls. The hot pot soup now 
looked like regular soup. 

“What’s this? It smells really nice. Can I eat some?” 

“It’s pome soup. I worked hard to get broth from the bird bone soup stock, so 
it should be really good. Try some.” 

Tuuli, her face up close to the pome soup, gave a sparkling smile and grabbed 
her spoon. “Wooow, it’s so good! How? This is amazing.” 

“Goodness, it is. I was surprised to see her boiling bird bones and putting in 
vegetables after just washing them, but this really does taste delicious,” said 
Mom earnestly after taking a bite herself. Given how experienced she was with 
this world’s cooking, she must have been worried despite the good smell. 

“Incredible, Myne. You’ve got a talent for cooking.” Dad, overjoyed, shoved 
the food into his face at an immense speed. 

I tried eating some of the pome soup myself. The bird bone broth had a really 
nice flavor and the vegetables added a lot. It tasted good, it really did. But. It 
wasn’t Japanese food. 

The next day, I finished gathering firewood in the forest and went home as 
soon as possible. Small kids had to stick together in a tight group at all times, but 
kids like Tuuli who had finished their baptism could leave the group and do 
whatever they wanted, with some prior notice. Thus, I went home early with 
Tuuli. 

I wanted to use the rest of the bird meat today, so Tuuli and I were sharing 
cooking duties. The second step of my plan to make Japanese-type food was to 
try and sake-steam the meat. I figured that any alcohol would work, not just 
Japanese sake. 

“So I’m guessing you already know what you want to make, Myne?” 

“I’m planning on (sake-steaming) the meat and making (gnocchi) with a 


salad. What do you think?” 

“Mmm, I don’t really know what you’re talking about, but okay. I’ll leave it 
you.” 

First came the gnocchi. I boiled potatoes, crushed them, and mixed in a bit of 
salt and multigrain flour. Commoners couldn’t afford to just casually use wheat 
flour, so we were left with multigrain flour. It was mostly made from rye, barley, 
and oats. Once the dough was about the consistency of an earlobe, I stretched it 
into round sticks and chopped them into centimeter-long chunks. 

“Could you stretch out the chunks I cut so they look like this?” 

“Uh huh.” Tuuli nodded enthusiastically after seeing me somewhat struggle 
to stretch out the dough while rubbing ridges in with the back of a fork and my 
thumb. The ridges would allow sauce to catch and stay on top of the gnocchi 
more easily. 

Tuuli stretched out the chunks of dough I cut one by one. She was stronger 
than me, so she prepared them faster and more neatly than I could have. 

“You’re better than me at this, Tuuli.” 

“You think so...? Myne, don’t watch me, keep cutting. I’ll run out.” 

I had Tuuli boil some water and begin cooking the gnocchi. Once it started 
really bubbling and the gnocchi floated to the top, they were ready. I added more 
pomes to yesterday's leftover soup and boiled it down into pome sauce. I would 
be mixing the gnocchi in before we ate, so that was all I could do right now. 

“I think that’s enough for now. We can finish the salads really fast, so...” 

“Mom’s coming home soon, so I think making the salad now would be 
smart.” 

Tuuli got to work making the salad and Mom came home before long. Once I 
saw her, I asked her to get the breast meat I prepared yesterday so I could start 
the sake-steaming. Despite having been stored within a cold room on cold stone, 
it wasn’t winter anymore and I felt compelled to sniff test the meat. Nmm... 

Okay, it’s not rotting. All good. 

“Myne, is this the skillet you want?” 

“Uh huh. Thanks, Tuuli. I salted and rubbed alcohol into it yesterday, so it 
should be ready soon.” Not having any pepper hurt, but there was nothing I 
could do about that. 

Sake-steaming the meat would be simple. I browned the skin side of the 
seasoned breast meat before flipping it, adding more alcohol, and covering the 
skillet. Since I had the opportunity, I wanted to add in the mushrooms I had 
gathered in the forest. I cleaned the mushrooms and got ready to cut them, when 


all of a sudden Tuuli shouted with her eyes open wide. 

“Don’t, Myne! Those mushrooms will dance if you don’t burn them first!” 
Tuuli immediately skewered the mushrooms with a stone stick and, after salting 
them, heated them on the hearth’s fire. 

Um... Mushrooms? Dance? Does she mean like how seaweed can wiggle 
around from the heat? I really don’t get it. I tilted my head, confused, and Tuuli 
offered me the now slightly burnt mushrooms. 

“Now they’re okay.” 

“Th-Thanks...” I was really thrown off, but if that’s all it took to make them 
edible, okay. The mushrooms were probably just another member of the bizarre 
food group. I needed to be careful before judging things by their appearance. 

Taking care not to get burned by the heated up mushrooms, I got to cutting. 
“Mom, which alcohol would be best for cooking? Just a little won’t make it taste 
that much better, so I want about half a cup.” 

“Good question... This is what you want.” Mom filled about half a cup with 
alcohol, which I took and poured into the pot by standing on something and 
stretching as much as I could. I put the cover back on the pot, and once the 
sizzling got loud enough, I took it off the fire and let it sit. Now we just had to 
wait for the lingering heat to do its work. 

“You’re already taking the pot off?” 

“It’s already hot enough to cook properly on its own. If you cook breast meat 
too much, it’ll get dry and hard to eat.” 

I warmed up the gnocchi and pome sauce made from the leftover soup, 
mixing them together as I did so, while Tuuli finished making the salad. Just like 
last time, the salad was topped with tenderloin. It seemed that everyone really 
loved it yesterday. 

“Today’s dinner is looking really fancy again, huh? Two days in a row!” 

“We really gotta thank Mr. Al.” 

Considering our financial situation, it was fairly rare for us to have this much 
food on the table. That bird really helped out. 

“I’m home. Things’re smelling good again.” Dad came home with a broad 
smile. He had been looking forward to today’s dinner ever since yesterday. He 
puffed out his chest and told us about how he’d bragged about our cooking at 
work. I got the feeling that in reality, he had annoyed everyone by being 
extremely proud and not shutting up about it. If that were the case, I’d feel kinda 
awkward going to the gate. 

“Time to eat.” 


“Wow, amazing! This tastes so good, Myne!” Tuuli’s eyes shot open with joy 
after she bit into the sliced, sake-steamed bird meat. 

Mom also smiled after taking a bite. “It’s a simple meal, but the breast meat 
is soft and nice. The mushrooms add a lot too; this truly does taste delicious. 

Was it because of the nice alcohol, I wonder?” 

“Maybe. The sweetness of the honeyed alcohol is really seeping into the 
meat.” The moment I said that, Dad paled, shot up out of his chair, and ran to the 
shelf with his liquor bottle. He hung his head looking close to tears upon seeing 
that the already small jar was now half-empty. 

“...M-My secret stash...” 

Sorry, sorry. But Dad, when I asked for some, Mom gave me a meaningful 
smile and told me that you had stealthily bought that without telling her, and that 
it’d be a waste if everyone didn’t get to enjoy it. For once, I actually managed to 
read between the lines. 

The honeyed alcohol made the food taste great, but it was sweet in a way that 
Japanese sake wasn’t, so the meal didn’t really taste like Japanese food. It was 
something entirely different. Aaah, I miss Japanese food. 

Being told all about the food here that supposedly “danced” and was 
“dangerous” surprised me a lot, but in the end, I could cook with similar recipes 
as I did back in Japan. On future days, I made potato gratin, quiche out of 
hardened multigrain bread dough, and so on. My family loved it all, but I 
personally wasn’t satisfied with any of it. I lacked the seasoning and spices to 
even make proper western food, so everything ended up tasting more or less the 
same. 

...At least give me pepper! And Vd be extra happy if you gave me some curry 
powder! My struggle to improve my diet was far from over. 


Mokkan and A Mysterious Fever 


The soot pencil I worked so hard to make dried and hardened after I left it to 
dry for a while. I wrapped it in a cloth to make a handle that I could hold without 
getting dirty. Once that was done, I sharpened its tip with a knife and tried 
writing. 

...It worked! The pencil crumbled easily, but it did write. I had invented a 
form of recording information even more ancient than books themselves, but 
still. Success was success. 

“Yay! It can write, Lutz!” 

“Oh nice, congrats.” 

Excited to have finally created a writing tool, I began to excitedly make more 
mokkan. I could make mokkan while picking up the firewood our family needed 
anyway, so it wasn’t too hard to make more of them. The best part was that I 
could do all of it by myself without relying on anyone else. I would run out of 
space eventually if I kept making them, but the same would have happened with 
clay tablets. I just had to endure until I grew up and could live on my own. 

Basically, I was pretty satisfied with my mokkan. But one day, I came home 
from the forest to find them all gone. They weren’t where I left them. 

“What?! Where are they?! Huh?!” 

“What’s wrong, Myne?” Mom poked her head into the storage room while I 
searched for the mokkan. 

I asked her where they were, thinking maybe she had moved them. “Mom, do 
you know where the (mokkan) are?” 

“Mo... what? Mmm? What are they?” Mom tilted her head in confusion, so I 
explained what mokkan were as simply as I could. 

“Umm, some are thin and some are thick, but they’re all pieces of flat wood 
with words written on them.” 

“Oh, the pieces of firewood you gathered? I used them.” 

“Wha? Huh? You used them?” My head went blank. 

“You worked so hard to reach the forest and gather firewood for us, Myne. I 
wouldn’t want to disappoint you and not use any of it.” 

“But the firewood is stacked over there. Why would you go out of your way 


to use the firewood I separated from the rest? They were a collection of the 
stories you’ve told me before bed!” 

“Oh, if you wanted me to tell you more stories, you could have just asked.” 
Mom patted my head happily, smiling to herself. 

“That’s not what I meant...” 

...They were all gone. I felt the life drain out of me as I looked at the empty 
space where mokkan used to be. It didn’t matter how hard I worked to make 
mokkan. They would just end up burned. Why even bother, then? 

The moment I gave up, drained, the heat I had been squashing down inside of 
me began to go wild as if growing in size rapidly. It felt as if the fevers I got 
when excited or tired were all forming together to make a super fever that 
numbed my limbs and left me immobile. 

“What’s going on...?” Without even understanding what was going on within 
my own body, I suddenly collapsed, stricken by an extremely intense fever. My 
consciousness fluttered. It felt like the heat stirring inside was slowly swallowing 
up my soul, eating me away bit by bit. It was only then that I realized the 
original Myne had probably been eaten away by this fever. 

It was burning hot and it hurt more than anything. Lacking the strength of 
heart to resist, I felt myself getting eaten away as my worried family flitted in 
and out of sight. In the midst of all that, I saw Lutz’s face drift through my mind 
for some reason. Why Lutz? I tried to make eye contact with him, and in my 
efforts, I pushed my consciousness out of the heat swallowing it up. I tensed 
around my temple and tried to look at him as hard as I could, which finally 
resulted in me seeing Lutz properly, rather than just as a vague vision. 

“Myne?” 

“...Lutz?” 

“Mrs. Effa! Myne’s woken up!” yelled Lutz. 

Mom immediately burst into the bedroom. “Myne ! You collapsed in the 
storeroom and just wouldn’t wake up. I was worried about you.” 

“I know. I saw your face sometimes. Sorry for worrying you. And... Mom. 

My throat’s dry. Also, I’m super sweaty. I want to wipe myself off. Can you 
bring me some water?” 

“Certainly. I’ll be right back.” After seeing Mom turn around and leave the 
room, I squeezed Lutz's hand while lying in bed, too weak to even lift my head. 

“...Lutz, it didn’t work again. Mom burned my mokkan.” 

“Aaah... Well, they probably just looked like pieces of wood with weird 
markings on them.” 


“But I worked so hard to make them, and separate them from the rest of the 
wood... I’m done. Finished. My dreams will never come true. I’ll never make a 
book.” I let out a sigh and felt the heat within my body intensify. I had to shake 
my head to stop my consciousness from fading away. 

“Cheer up. You just have to make’m out of something they can’t burn.” 

Wood’s no good. So I just make it out of something else. Something they 
can’t burn. Lutz’s advice gave me a flash of inspiration. ...Now’s not the time to 
be lying in bed with a fever. I need to figure out what else I could make 
something with. I tensed my whole body, determined to survive, and felt the heat 
shrinking into the middle of my body. 

“...What do you think I can use that won’t get burned?” I thought hard about 
it, but couldn’t think of anything myself. Maybe because the fever was making it 
hard to think, maybe because I wasn’t familiar enough with what materials even 
existed in this area. 

“Uuuh, like, bamboo or something?” 

“...Lutz, you’re a genius.” Bamboo exploded when burned, so Mom wouldn’t 
try using it as firewood without good reason. I felt hope brimming within me. 
And somehow, that made the heat shrink a little further, making it easier to 
breathe. 

“My my, what are you two talking about?” Mom walked in with a bucket of 
water. Lutz and I looked at each other, then laughed a little to ourselves. 

“It’s a secret, Mom.” 

“I’ll go get some for you. So, get better.” 

“Thanks, Lutz. You’re so nice.” 

“Th-This is just so you can introduce me to Mr. Otto, alright? I’ve already 
done my part, so I’ll be pissed if you don’t get better! Alright?” Lutz rushed out 
of the room, so I started to wipe myself down with the water Mom had brought 
me. 

...There was something weird about that fever. It felt like it was coming from 
within my body and eating me away. I don’t know of any fevers like that. I 
definitely don’t know of any fever that suddenly expands, or shrinks when you 
focus. Just what is the fever stirring inside of my body right now? 

When I first came to this world, I caught fevers so often I didn’t think 
anything of them. But now that I had built up strength and could move around 
without issue, there was definitely something weird. What in the world am I sick 
with? 

Unfortunately, this world wasn’t prosperous enough for commoners to 


casually see doctors, nor were there any home medical almanacs. It would take 
some time for me to investigate this. Since the fever shrinks if I focus hard on it, 
maybe I don ’ t need to rush ? 

I passed two days thinking about how to deal with my fever, and then Lutz 
really did bring me some pieces of bamboo perfect for making into mokkan. He 
had already carved them flat so that I could write on them. 

“Don’t even think about touching them until you’re better. You break this 
promise and I won’t ever help you again, alright?” 

“Okay. Thanks, Lutz.” I watched Lutz hurry home, then gripped a piece of 
bamboo in my hand. 

I asked Mom to store the rest in the storage room. I still couldn’t get out of 
bed, but once this fever went all the way down, I would write on them and finish 
my book. I needed to get better. My eyelids slowly lowered as I held the bamboo 
Lutz had brought for me. But right before I could fall asleep, I heard loud 
explosions. 

“Kyaaah? ! ” 

“Wh-What?! What’s happening?!” I heard explosion after explosion bursting 
from the kitchen. 

Mom rushed into the bedroom, looking tense. “Myne! What did Lutz bring 
you?!” 

“...Bamboo?” 

“Gracious! You should have said something! I thought he had gathered 
firewood for you!” Mom’s complaining made me realize what had caused the 
explosions. She had burned the bamboo as firewood. Those explosions had been 
a lot more powerful than what I expected from bamboo, but well, this was 
another world after all. 

“Did you think it was firewood since they were carved flat...? Wait, you can’t 
tell bamboo and wood apart?” 

“You know that bamboo and the wood of banhit trees look alike.” 

“No, I’ve never seen a tree like that...” I didn’t even recognize the name. At 
the very least, I had never seen bamboo or any trees resembling it while going to 
the forest. 

“What are you talking about? It’s the wood Tuuli used to make baskets over 
the winter. Didn’t you help her, Myne?” 

“Oh, now I remember. They do look similar without any bark.” I did know 
about the wood, since I had watched Tuuli prepare for her winter handiwork. It 


looked like normal wood when it had bark, but once peeled, it looked similar to 
bamboo. 

“In any case, bamboo is dangerous. Don’t bring it into the house. 
Understand?”
