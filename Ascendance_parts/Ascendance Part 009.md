was a matter of life or death. 

“A- Anyway! The point is, I’m not a cheap enough girl to work for free.” 

“...I think those are some pretty cheap terms, but alright.” Otto gave a wry 
smile and agreed to officially become my teacher. 

“What should I do?” 

“Would you mind making sure the calculations here are correct? Basically, I 
don’t know where the mistakes are, so checking over everything is taking up a 
lot of time.” 

Apparently he was in the middle of checking paperwork someone else had 
made. It was obvious given that this world had no computers, but despite how 
long it took to make paperwork, the calculations written on that paperwork all 
had to be checked manually. 

“I guess you guys need another soldier that can do math.” 

“...That would be nice, but I only got hired in the first place 'cause I can do 
this kinda stuff, so...” 

It sounded like there were some deep circumstances behind Otto becoming a 
soldier. As someone starved for any sort of information, I was itching to ask for 
details right away, but our workload was so great I swallowed my curiosity and 
bottled it up for later. 

“Myne, do you need the calculator?” 

“I don’t even know how they work, so I’ll just use my stone slate.” The slate 
could easily work in place of scrap paper for calculations since everything 
written on it could be erased. 

I wrote down math on the slate and helped him with his double-checking 
work. The numbers of this world had completely entered my head and thinking 
about the number nine was all it took for the proper symbol to appear in my 
mind. Writing them was no issue. 

“Holy crap, that was easy. I’m impressed, Myne, and I owe you big time. I 
never thought I’d finish all this double-checking work so soon. Y’know, Myne, 
with math skills like that, you would be a great merchant. I can introduce you to 
the Merchant’s Guild if you want.” 

Otto had apparently been stuck handling all the financial paperwork himself 
for years, so he ended up extremely thankful for my help. 

I might want to start a bookstore once I learn how to mass produce books. 
Getting a connection to the Merchant’s Guild here may pay off big time. Plus, it 
looks like Otto’s thinking of me as an important helper now. Perfect. 


“Myne, if you really wanna learn your letters, I’ll take teaching you seriously. 
That way, you can help me with my written paperwork too next year.” 

“Really?! Yaaay!” 

“Huh? Is that something to be happy about?” Otto blinked in surprise, but 
why wouldn’t I be happy about him taking my learning seriously? 

I mean, helping with paperwork means touching parchment, right? It means 
writing letters with ink, right? That sounds amazing if you ask me! 


Tuuli’s Hair Ornament 


One morning, several days after I stayed at the gate, Mom finally finished the 
dress she had been working so hard on for Tuuli. 

Fundamentally, it was a one-piece dress sewn together from unbleached 
cloth. The fanciest part of the design was embroidery around the sleeves and 
neckline. Around its waist was a wide sash with a cool blue color that gave the 
dress an elegant flair. 

It was cute, for sure, but I had memories of Japanese fashion where kids wore 
fancy dresses, kimonos, and just generally vibrant clothing at festivals. Tuuli’s 
dress felt a little lacking in comparison. 

“So, Myne? Is it cute?” 

Well yes, but it’d be cuter if you added more frills and decoration. I kept my 
thoughts to myself, though, because Mom looked full of pride and Tuuli was 
happy. By this world’s standards, the dress was surely more than good enough. 
Not to mention that this was a dress one wore when visiting a holy temple. 
Maybe a flashier dress would cause problems. 

I shouldn’t talk about things I don’t understand, and there’s a lot about this 
world’s fashion I don’t understand. But there is something I think I can talk 
about. Her hair. Tuuli’s hair had gotten a lot more glossy thanks to regular 
shampooing and care, but she always kept it up in a braid. If she planned on 
changing her hair style for the festival, a nice hair ornament would add a lot. 

But I needed to learn more about this stuff before I did anything. Myne was 
too young to have any memories of the baptism. 

“It’s cute, Tuuli! But... what about your hair? Are you going to do anything 
special for the baptism?” 

“Well, I wasn’t planning to?” 

Tuuli... Come on. It’s a special occasion, you gotta mix things up a little! I 
slumped my head reflexively, but I shook myself out of it and continued 
questioning her. A hair ornament could still work with her normal braid. 

“Ummm, well, what about a hair ornament? Are you going to wear anything 
on your hair?” 

“Hm, I don’t know. It’ll be summer, so maybe I’ll grab a flower?” 


“No way, that’d be terrible! Think about how cute your dress is!” 

It was frowned upon for children to wear their hair completely up, but 
braiding was fine, and we could just make a hair ornament if she didn’t have 
one. I could make a lace one myself. There was still time before summer. 

“I’ll make you one, Tuuli! Let me make you one. It’ll definitely be super 
cute.” The moment after I said that, I realized I didn’t have the needles I needed 
for sewing lace. Mom had needles for sewing wool, but they were too thick for 
lace. 

...O-Oh no! What do I do?! The only one in my family that could probably 
make needles from scratch was Dad. The long hair stick that Tuuli gave me had 
actually been carved down and smoothed out by Dad. He even finished it with 
an oil coating. 

I glanced to the side, checking to see what kind of mood Dad was in. Several 
days had passed since Otto taught me letters at the gate, but he was still in a bad 
mood. I doubted he would be very receptive to begging. 

“U-Um, Dad.” 

“What?” 

“You’re pretty good with your hands, aren’t you? You made Tuuli’s doll, 
right?” 

“W-Well, yeah, pretty much. Ahem! Aaah, what, do you want a doll too?” He 
was frowning hard to show that he was mad, but nonetheless, his eyes gleamed 
with anticipation and he kept glancing at me. 

“Nuh uh. I want sewing needles.” 

“Sewing needles? Like the kind your Mom uses? Just borrow hers.” Dad’s 
face fell with disappointment the moment he heard my answer. He looked so, 
well, pathetic that I wished he would at least try to act a little tougher. 

“I want needles a lot, lot more thin than those. I want to sew thread, not wool. 
Dad... I think it’d be really hard to make thin needles, but, would you pleeease 
make me some?” I looked up at him with wet eyes, hands clasped in front of my 
chest, as I made the cutest begging pose I could manage. 

I didn’t know if this world understood the significance of puppy dog eyes, 
but fathers of all worlds and universes should be weak to their daughter’s 
cuteness... Hopefully. 

My cuteness must have done the trick, as Dad stroked his stubble and fell 
into thought. “...Is wood fine?” 

“Uh huh! Can you make them? They need to be really thin.” 

“I’ll give it a shot.” Tickling his pride probably helped, as he immediately 


took out a few knives and began carving a chunk of wood. 

He was used to carving with knives and worked fast. The bark of the thin 
branch was gone in no time, leaving just the hard inner wood. He then sliced off 
layer after layer of the wood while looking at Mom’s thicker needles as a 
reference. 

“Is this thin enough?” 

“Mmm, could you make it a little thinner?” 

“This much?” 

“That much!” 

After carving the branches down to the proper thickness, he swapped out 
knives and began carving out the pointed tips. His work wasn’t good enough to 
be that of a professional, but I for sure couldn’t do it myself, so I was genuinely 
impressed. 

“You’re amazing, Dad! They already look like good needles. If you would 
just smooth them out so the thread doesn’t catch on them, and give them an oil 
finish, they’ll be perfect.” 

“Leave it to me.” His pride as a father must have been restored by my praise, 
as Dad got to work smoothing out the thin needles with an exceptionally pleased 
expression. 

“Myne, it looks like Dad’s all cheered up now. I’m so glad!” Tuuli beamed 
the innocent smile of an angel. 

I nodded in return, saying “Uh huh, I’m glad too,” while sweating on the 
inside. It’s my fault he was upset in the first place, ahaha... 

Since Dad was working hard on my needles, I started looking for thread so I 
could get to work as soon as they were ready. We had plenty of thread left over 
since Mom had prepared plenty for Tuuli’s dress. The white thread and the 
unbleached thread that she had used to sew cloth would still be useful to her. But 
the colored thread she had used for the edges and the sash only had tiny snippets 
left over. They wouldn’t be that useful. 

“Mom, can I have the rest of the colored thread?” 

“What do you want it for?” Mom, surprised that I would want thread, gave 
me a puzzled look. 

“I want to try some (lacework). Tuuli needs a hair ornament.” 

My Japanese mother hadn’t just taught me how to make baskets, she had 
dipped her toes in all manner of arts and crafts, taking me along for the ride. I 
really wish she hadn’t bothered, but she was set on getting me interested in 
something other than books and got me wrapped up in whatever the latest craze 


was. 

Basically, I had just as much experience with a million random things as she 
did. And one of those random things was lacework, which actually ended up 
relatively useful to me back then. I was confident that I could make a lace 
ornament if given the tools. My life as Urano was over, but my past experience 
kept proving useful in unexpected ways. 

That said, since Mom had no way of knowing about my past life, she was 
hesitant to give me thread. She definitely thought doing so would just be a waste 
of good thread, given how often I’ve “wasted” things in the past. 

“She’ll only need an ornament for the baptism, you know. Why waste thread 
on something so frivolous? A flower is more than good enough. Tuuli’s already 
cute enough as is.” 

“If there’s a way to make her cuter, it’s wrong not to do it! Cuteness is 
justice!” I clenched my fist to show my resolve, but Mom just sighed for some 
reason and turned her back to me, signaling that the conversation was over. 

I hurriedly grabbed onto her skirt and began begging. “Please, Mooom. I just 
need your extra thread. I want to use the needles Dad worked hard to make for 
me! He’s almost finished with them. Pleaaaase.” 

I looked at Dad for help, hinting that the needles would be wasted without 
thread. He must have understood the meaning to my glance and, perhaps fearing 
his efforts being wasted, or perhaps fearing losing my respect, backed me up. 

“Effa, it’s not often Myne gets interested in sewing. Why not give her some 
of your spare thread?” 

“...You’re right.” After thinking about it for a bit, Mom reluctantly gave me 
the thread too short for her to do anything with. 

“Yay! Thanks, Mom. I love you, Dad.” I shot my fists into the air, showing 
my happiness. Dad grinned. He grinned so, so hard as he sped up his heated 
carving. 

I wonder if all dads act like this when their daughter is sweet to them. Well... 
Now that he’s happy, I guess it’s okay if I stop worrying about him for a bit? 

Dad gave me the needles, packed uncomfortably full with his fatherly love, 
so I went and started the lacework right away. First up was making a bunch of 
tiny flowers. 

Fiddle fiddle fiddle fiddle... 

Facework required tightly weaving the strands just like my failed faux- 
papyrus did, so I needed some firm determination to succeed. But since this time 
I was making tiny flowers, and it only took me fifteen minutes to finish one. 


I set the yellow flower on the table and got to work on the next one. Tuuli 
looked at the lace flower with admiration before tilting her head a bit in 
confusion. 

“Isn’t it a bit small?” 

“The ornament’s going to be a lot of tiny flowers bundled together.” 

You see... Making one big flower would be a problem if I got bored halfway 
through, right? Once again, I kept my thoughts to myself. 

I had talked big and now needed to finish the ornament for Tuuli no matter 
what. A design built around tiny flowers allowed me to duck out whenever I 
wanted. 

To tell the truth, back in my Urano days, I had given up on a lot of big 
designs before finishing them. Predicting problems and avoiding them before 
they happened just made sense. 

“I thought about making a lace ribbon, but it’d need to be long enough to tie, 
and it’d be a problem if I ran out of the same color thread before it was done. So, 
I’ll just make lots of little flowers.” 

“You really thought this through, Myne.” 

“Of course I did! I’m doing all this for you, Tuuli.” 

I put my all into making a cute hair ornament for Tuuli, as thanks for always 
taking care of me. Since I would be bundling together finished flowers, it 
wouldn’t matter if I quit halfway through, ran out of thread, or needed to swap 
colors to keep going. No thread would be wasted. 

Fiddle fiddle fiddle fiddle... 

I felt someone looking at me after making several flowers and instinctively 
looked up. Mom was staring at my hands, entranced. 

Given that being good at sewing was a requirement for being a beauty, 
everyone recognized Mom as a beautiful woman. That probably led to her being 
interested in all sorts of sewing. 

She picked up the finished flowers and rolled them around in her hands. 
“...These don’t seem too hard to make.” 

“You’re so used to sewing wool and stuff, I think you’d be a lot better at 
making these than me if you learned how. Want to try?” 

I handed Mom my needles and she got to work, looking at the small flowers. 
She would occasionally pause to fiddle with the flowers, and in no time she had 
finished one of her own. 

Wooow. Just what I’d expect from a sewing beauty. She learned how to make 
them just by looking at them. Meanwhile, it took me forever to learn even when 


being taught step by step, since I just didn’t care. 

“That’s really good, Mom.” 

“I’m more impressed that you knew how to make these in the first place, 
Myne. I’ve made scarves and sweaters, but I never thought about making 
ornaments like this before.” 

In this world where it took all one had just to stay alive, most people didn’t 
have the leeway to worry about decorations. Nobody made hair ornaments like 
this, and Mom might not have ever seen any lacework in her whole life. I knew 
about this kind of thing since I had been raised in a world where attaching 
decorations to one’s clothes was normal, but even small little lace flowers were 
weird in this world. 

“So, Myne. How will you put all of these little flowers onto her head?” Mom 
couldn’t imagine what the completed product would look like from the strewn 
about flowers, so I gave her as simple of an explanation as I could manage. 

“Ummm, well, we’ll make a circle with these leftovers, and sew each flower 
onto them one by one. It’ll look like a bouquet of flowers, right? Then we’ll just 
stick a (pin) through it, and... wait, a (pin)?!” 

The blood drained from my face. I even let out a tiny shriek, which made 
Mom flinch with surprise. 

“What’s wrong, Myne?!” 

“Oh no... We don’t have a (pin).” 

This is big trouble! I don’t think this world has pins. At the very least, I’ve 
never seen them at home. This is a world without hair scrunchies! A world where 
everyone bundles their hair with tiny strings! What’s going to happen to my 
precious ornament?! 

“D-D-Daaad!” Explaining with words would be hard, so I took out my slate 
and sketched what I needed. “I want a tiny hairpin kind of like mine, except one 
that has a flat end with a tiny hole in it! Can you make one?!” 

“Heh, that’ll be easier than your needles.” 

“Really?! You’re amazing, Dad! I’ve never respected anyone this much in my 
life!” I got so emotional that I hugged Tuuli hard as Dad muttered to himself, 
“Heheh. I beat you, Otto.” Apparently he had been secretly competing with Otto. 

Dad enthusiastically made me a tiny hairpin, so I took it and sewed the mini¬ 
bouquet onto it, much like one would sew on a button. 

“Okay, done! Tuuli, put on your dress and sit here, please.” 

Wearing her summer dress, Tuuli sat on the nearest seat to the furnace. I slid 
my own chair behind her and stood on top of it after removing my shoes. I then 


undid Tuuli’s braid, combed her hair, and started braids on both sides. 

Tuuli’s hair was fluffy and had a natural perm, so I stopped the braids 
halfway through to give her a more elegant look that would be sure to stun 
anyone who saw her. To finish things off, I stuck the ornament’s pin into the 
crude string that was keeping the end of her braids together. The tiny white, blue, 
and yellow flowers looked great on her green hair. 

“Yep, super cute!” 

“My goodness! You’re adorable, Tuuli!” 

“You’ve got some good hands on you, Myne. Maybe you’ve got a future 
working with your hands?” 

Tuuli, smiling from her family’s praise, turned every which way while 
touching her hair and the ornament. 


But eventually, she pouted a little. “Myne, you put it on the back of my head. 

I can’t see it at all.” 

“That’s true, but... what can you do?” 

“Well, I still want to know what it looks like.” 

Our home had no mirrors, so I had no way of showing her what it looked 
like. I thought for a second about what I could do, and although it wasn’t the best 
solution, Tuuli looked so frustrated that I undid her ornament and put it on my 
myself, next to my own hairpin. 

“It looks like this. What do you think?” 

“Wooow, cute! You look amazing! Um, Mom? Did I look like this too?” 

Tuuli cried out with eager excitement after seeing what the ornament looked like 
on me. 

“Myne braided your hair and colored the flowers to suit you, so you looked 
even cuter, Tuuli.” 

“Wooow... Huh. Ahahaha... Thank you, everyone. I’m really happy.” Tuuli 
broke into a ridiculously happy smile and blushed as she took the ornament off 
my hair. 

And so, Tuuli’s special outfit was completed before spring. There was no 
doubting that she’d be the star of this summer’s baptism. 

Also, Mom ended up addicted to lacework, and before I knew it the needles 
Dad made for me were in her sewing box. 


Bring Me to The Forest 


The forest snow had started to melt and seeds were growing, or so Tuuli told 
me after coming back from the forest. 

Kids going to the forest for gathering meant that my horrible hibernation was 
over. I had learned how terribly full of spare time life was without books, but 
never again would I suffer through that. 

Because now, I can make clay tablets! Tuuli said that there’s still so much 
snow it’s hard to walk and there’s not much to gather anyway. But the relative 
lack of plant life is no problem to me. 

What I want is sticky clay, and I’ll find it if I dig into the ground. I want to go 
to the forest and make clay tablets. As long as I can reach the forest, it’s my win. 

Of course, I wouldn’t be going to the forest alone. I needed Tuuli by my side, 
to keep an eye on me. Which meant I needed to do a little more begging. 

“Please, Tuuli,” I said while sliding up to her. “I want to go to the forest too. I 
want to be friends with everyone. Please take me with you to the forest!” 

“No way. You can’t walk that far.” Her response was the exact same as last 
time. But if I backed down, it was all over. I had to resolve her lack of trust. 

“I’ve gotten a little stronger! If I can’t walk that far, I’ll just wait at the gate. 
Please.” 

Tuuli was hesitant, but I had spent every day exercising, eating healthily, 
walking to the well with Tuuli to wash dishes, and just generally building up 
strength. I should be strong enough to go by now. 

“...Only if Dad says okay.” Tuuli gave up on shaking me off and dumped the 
responsibility onto Dad. That was inevitable anyway, since he would need to 
take care of me if I had to stop at the gate. 

I shifted my sights to convincing Dad. “Dad, can I go to the forest too? I 
haven’t gotten any fevers lately!” 

“Good point...” 

I had been very careful over the winter, so I only got fevers and passed out 
five times total. Um... That’s a lot less, okay? My family was really impressed. 
They’re like, wow, that’s amazing, you’re doing so much better. And they mean 
it! 


Not being bedridden with fevers all the time meant that I could eat decent 
meals more often, which naturally meant that I ended up with more nutrition, 
and I started growing a bit more. I wasn’t as tall as the average kid my age, but I 
had definitely gotten stronger. Probably. 

“If I really can’t make it, I’ll just rest at the gate. Please? Pleeease?” 

Dad fell into thought. The fact he didn’t turn me down immediately like Tuuli 
gave me hope. I kept up my attack, wanting his permission no matter what. 

“I just need to get used to it. There are three-year-olds that go to the forest, 
right? There’s no way I can’t go myself.” 

“Aaah, I mean, that’s true, but... Those are the three-year-olds so packed with 
energy that they rampage around the house. Their parents are basically kicking 
them out, alright?” 

“...So I can go to the forest if I throw a tantrum?”
