They’re out of reach for me. So what can I do but make them myself? Paper’s 
also too expensive, so I’ll make (clay tablets), write stories on them, and harden 
them.” 

With that, Lutz finally clapped his hands together in understanding. “You’re 
making replacements for books right now, huh?” 

“Yeah! Things didn’t go well last time, but that’s the past! I’ll make sure it 
works out this time ! ” 

“Alright. I’ll help out.” Lutz was willing to go this far for me just because I 
shared a few recipes, which made me want to help him too. 

“Okay then, what do you want to do, Lutz? It sounded like you have 
something you really want to do yourself.” 

“I... Yeah. I want to go to other cities. You know how the bards and traveling 
merchants go to all sorts of places and know all sorts of things? I wanna do that 
too.” 

“Uh huh, that sounds really cool.” Speaking of which, back in my Urano 
days, I often dreamed of traveling the world to visit all sorts of foreign libraries 
and read their books. Thoughts of that now-unattainable dream flashed through 
my mind, and soon I lowered my eyes. 

“...You really think that? I mean, I’d be leaving this city, y’know?” 

“Aaah, traveling seems wonderful. You can go all over the place, it seems 
like so much fun. Like, I actually dreamed of traveling all over the (Earth) and 
visiting tons of (libraries)...” 

“Haaah... I dunno why I was worried about saying that. Man, Myne. You’re 
definitely gonna do what you want to do.” 

“What’s stopping you from doing the same, Lutz?” My head was so full of 
my Urano dreams and wishes that I wasn’t actually looking at him. I didn’t see 
what kind of face he was making. 

Once we finally reached a dry part of the road, we walked on and soon came 
upon the forest. The slightly open part right inside was our meeting place. 

“Alright, let’s get to gathering, everyone. If you’re a littler kid, don’t go too 
far. Always stay where you can see the meeting place. Alright?” The larger kids 
made sure the little kids understood the rules before taking their bows and 
jogging deeper into the forest. The little kids glanced furtively in my direction. I 
was already exhausted just from walking to the forest, but I immediately began 
investigating the area to see what had become of my clay tablets. 

“Um, does anyone know where the (tablets) are?” I couldn’t find the tree the 


other kids had marked for me. At first I thought I had just forgotten where it was, 
since it had been several days since then, but everyone else was looking around 
too, just as lost as I was. 

“We definitely put the marker on a tree around here, didn’t we?” 

Fey’s cronies all nodded together. He was pointing at a place where several 
trees had fallen from the storm. 

“Well, we’ve got an idea on where they are, so we just gotta search.” Once 
Lutz began digging through the shrubbery, everyone else hesitantly joined in and 
searched with him. 

And it’s not just Fey’s friends, but everyone... They’re all such nice kids. 

“Hey, ain’t these it?” 

It took a lot of work to find the marker, but Fey waved me over while 
squatting by some bushes. I dashed over there as fast as I could and found 
clumps of clay stuck together without any visible letters on them. As expected, 
the rain had messed them so much all my work had been erased. The tablets had 
returned to their original form. Aaah... Back to square one. 

“I-I didn’t break them this time, a’ight?!” 

“...I know that.” 

Fey hurriedly covered for himself, but he didn’t have to. I knew it wasn’t his 
fault. I also knew everyone was buzzing around me, uncertain of what to do, not 
knowing whether they should console me or not. I knew I was stressing 
everyone out, but I couldn’t stop my tears from flowing out. 

As I sobbed quietly to myself, I heard footsteps approach. They stopped, and 
then moments later, someone hit me lightly on the head. 

“Myne, if you’ve got the time to cry, you’ve got the time to make more 
tablets.” Lutz’s voice broke through to me. He was right. I just had to try again, 
while Fey and the others were still willing to help me. 

I wiped away my snot and looked up. Right... I won’t let the world beat me! I 
first failed because of Fey. I then failed because of a storm. Fvejust experienced 
human and natural disasters. What else could the world throw at me? No matter 
what happens, Fll finish these tablets! 

The clay I needed was right in front of me, so I just had to squish them into 
shape to start writing again. I knew where to get more if I ran out. Compared to 
when I was cluelessly searching for clay on my own, things were great. 

...This is okay. Fm not back at square one at all. From these failures Fve 
learned that I either need to finish the tablets all at once on a sunny day, or I 
need to work in a building with a roof. Today’s weather is nice, and I have three 


helpers with more than enough strength and energy to spare. Fey and his cronies 
are only helping because of the promise they made out of fear, but still. With this 
many helpers, I should be able to finish the clay tablets in no time. 

“I only need Lutz, Fey, and Fey’s friends’ help. You can go focus on 
gathering, Tuuli.” 

“Okay... Good luck, everyone.” 

“Yeah!” 

Tuuli' s encouragement brightened my mood and I got right to work making 
new clay tablets. I had Fey and his first crony dig out more clay, then I had Lutz 
and Fey’s second crony squeeze the clay into the shape of tablets. My job was 
just using a thin stick to carve letters into them. Uh huh, things are going 
perfectly. 

“I needed ten (clay tablets) to write the whole story, so once you’ve made that 
many, you can go start gathering. Thanks!” 

“Y-Yeah.” Fey and the others lined up tablets one by one in front of me, 
finishing all ten as soon as possible before running off to gather. And yet, Lutz 
kept digging out more clay. 

“You’re not going to go gather?” 

“Ralph’s here today, so I can stick around and help you instead.” 

“Hmm. Well, I have enough clay, so why don’t you practice writing on the 
ground?” The ground was soft due to all the rain, so I took my stick and carved 
“Lutz” into it, using the letters of this world. 

“What’s that...?” 

“Your name, Lutz. You won’t be able to travel the world if you can’t write 
your name, right?” People of our city could go in and out of the gate without 
much fanfare, but apparently strangers entering new towns were asked their 
name and had to write it down. Otto, a former traveling merchant, had told me 
that. The same was true for our city. Any strangers were checked quite severely 
before being let inside. If Lutz wanted to visit other cities someday, he had to at 
least learn how to write his own name. 

“Hey, Myne. This is, uh, my name?” 

“Uh huh. If you want to travel the world, you should start learning your 
letters.” Lutz started to practice writing his name on the ground with his green 
eyes sparkling. Meanwhile, I continued to write a story I had learned in this 
world in Japanese. I will DEFINITELY finish making this book, I chanted to 
myself over and over. 


“Done!” I had finished writing one of the stories Mom had told me. I wanted 
to keep going and make Bedtime with Mom: A Short Story Collection out of clay 
tablets. It would be a “book” packed with stories I had learned for the first time 
by coming to this world. 

I wrapped the finished clay tablets in the rags and stacked them carefully 
inside my basket, making sure not to break them or rub the words off. Once they 
were all inside, I let out a heavy sigh. My eyes turned upward and tears dripped 
out. 

I had finished my first “book.” 

Really, clay tablets weren’t a sophisticated enough medium to really call 
books, but they were the closest thing I had in this world. I had begun life in this 
world at the end of fall, and spring was now ending. It took a very, very long 
time for me to get my first book. But now that I had made one, I got the feeling 
that my life here had finally stabilized. 

“I can read books again. I can read books in this world. So... I think I’ll be 
fine.” Since I had been reborn in a world where books were too expensive for 
poor people to read, and I had been reborn into a weak body that got sick over 
nothing, I never really cared about pushing myself too hard. I didn’t care if I 
ended up dying. This sickly child’s body didn’t feel like mine, and I couldn’t 
imagine living in a world without books. I had no attachment to anything. 

But now that I had a book, I had something I wanted to take care of. I got the 
feeling that I had finally found something worth living for in this world. I had 
found my path in this life. 

“You finished, Myne?” 

“Uh huh. I finished, thanks to everyone’s help.” Even if Lutz and Tuuli’s 
feelings were for Myne, not me, they had in fact helped me make this book. I 
took off the rag and showed Tuuli and Lutz the finished clay tablets. 

“Um, Myne. What’s written on these?” 

“This is the story of the star children. The one Mom told me on that first 
night.” 

“Lirst?” Tuuli furrowed her brows in confusion. 

“Uh huh. It’s the first story that I remember.” 

Mom had whispered the story to me in a quiet voice the night I first became 
Myne, when I had such a high fever I couldn’t sleep. Her voice was filled with 
love, but it felt to me that her love was for someone else, not me. I didn’t accept 
having become Myne, so Mom’s feelings and words went in one ear and out the 
other. They just made my confusion worse. Nothing in the world hurt more than 


Mom’s love, for it worsened my sense of isolation. 

And yet, when I decided to make my own books, the story she told me was 
the first thing that came to mind. I got the feeling that by turning Mom’s stories 
into a book, I would be able to accept the love contained within them. 

“I, um, I really want to write down all the stories Mom told me, so I don’t 
forget them.” 

“But won’t the letters just disappear again?” Tuuli looked worried, but I just 
smiled. 

“They will if I leave them like this, which is why I’ll heat them up to harden 
them. Then we can read Mom’s stories whenever we want.” 

About half a year had passed since I began life in this world. And finally, for 
the first time, I smiled a truly sincere smile. 

It would have been beautifully emotional for things to end right there, but 
sadly, I was not so lucky. I wanted to heat the tablets up as soon as I got home, 
so I waited for Mom to be distracted and immediately put the tablets on the 
hearth. Whereupon they exploded. 

I’m not kidding. You may think I’m just telling a joke, but it really happened. 

I heated them on the hearth, and boom! My first book turned to dust and rubble. 

I just stood there in a daze, and before I could figure out what went wrong, Mom 
yelled at me and made me swear not to make clay tablets a second time. 

...Wait, what? Did I just get thrown back to square one for real? Um... Well, 
emotionally speaking, I feel a lot better, so maybe it’s like... Three steps forward, 
two steps back? Umm... Wh-What should I do now? 


Tuuli’s Baptism 


...If only I could have fired those clay tablets in the hearth and preserved 
them. Haaah. I really didn’t expect them to just explode like that. If only I had a 
knife like Tuuli, I could make some mokkan. 

I was banned from making clay tablets after they exploded in the hearth, and 
while I was stuck thinking about how to proceed with bookmaking, Tuuli turned 
seven. 

It was customary in this world to throw large celebrations for one’s seventh 
birthday. Or to be more precise, birth season, rather than birthday. A large 
baptism was held at the temple each season and all children in the city turning 
seven would go there to be baptized. They’d be able to work as apprentices after 
that, so I suppose one could say they were joining the workforce. I felt kind of 
uncomfortable about a religious event being mandatory, but when I thought 
about it like the shrine visits I’d go on in Japan as a child, it felt more natural. 
Weird. 

Since children under the age of seven weren’t allowed to enter the temple, I 
couldn’t watch the baptism myself. But neither could Dad. In a stroke of bad 
luck, Dad had a meeting on the day of Tuuli’s baptism that he just couldn’t 
avoid. The meeting had been ordered by an archnoble, one of a higher-ranked 
family in noble society, and thus his head would literally fly if he didn’t go. 
Literally?! Really?! That’s scary! 

And yet, despite that, Dad had been complaining since morning, showing no 
signs of going to work. “Don’t wanna. Who cares about the meeting. This is 
Tuuli’s baptism, y’know? Why would I care about a meeting on a day like this?” 

It was true that Tuuli’s baptism was a very special day. I imagined that the 
noble had children of his own, so I didn’t get why he wouldn’t be understanding 
of the situation. “Wait. Do noble children not go get baptized?” I asked. 

“...I’ve heard that they don’t go to the temple. They summon the priests to 
their home. Nobles don’t understand how we commoners feel.” 

I had been enduring his complaining since I imagined he just needed to calm 
down a little, but he had been going since last night and just wouldn’t stop. Do 
all worlds share how annoying a daughter-obsessed father gets when he misses 


an important day with his children? I sighed while diligently combing Tuuli’s 
hair from the middle outward. 

“Dad, I’ll go with you, so don’t skip work. We can go with Tuuli on the way 
there. And anyway, only children get to go inside the temple. Parents have to 
wait outside in the plaza.” 

He would probably feel better if he tagged along and saw Tuuli mixing with 
the other children in her dress. And yet, even with that suggestion in mind, Dad 
kept up complaining. 

“It’s a father’s duty to wait outside the temple.” 

“Isn’t going to work and making money a father’s duty too?” 

“Ngh!” 

“I’m done with this. If you don’t want to go to work with me that much, you 
can go on your own.” I let out a hmph, causing Dad to look my way with tearful 
eyes full of sorrow. 

“...I’ll go to work with you, Myne. But I’ll go right back to the temple plaza 
once the meeting’s over. We’re definitely gonna celebrate tonight.” 

Tuuli couldn’t move her head while I was braiding her hair, so she looked at 
Dad with just her eyes and smiled. “Geez, Dad. I know that. We’ll definitely 
celebrate together. And I’m really excited for it, so hurry home.” 

“Yeah.” Tuuli’s smile shot Dad’s mood into the heavens. I could only clap my 
hands in awe of her angelic power. 

And then she made a request to me with that smile still in place. “Myne, keep 
an eye on Dad and make sure he goes to work, okay?” 

“Leave it to me! I’ll work hard so you can relax and go to the baptism.” 

“Wha, Myne?!” Dad’s pitiful behavior finally made Tuuli burst into laughter. 
She had a nice smile. With this much overwhelming love thrown her way, she 
wouldn’t feel lonely even without Dad waiting outside for her. 

“Okay, done. You’re looking super cute, Tuuli.” 

“Thanks, Myne.” 

I had braided both the left and right sides of her hair in a half-up style, 
finishing things off with her hair ornament. It consisted of the tiny lace flowers I 
had made over the winter and looked like a bouquet. The variety of colored 
flowers suited Tuuli’s dress and her bright, soft personality. 

“My my, Tuuli. She really did pretty you up.” 

“Wha... Mom?” 

As she was going to the temple with Tuuli as well, Mom was wearing her 
best outfit. It was a simple, light-blue dress that stopped right above her shoes 


and gave her a dignified look. To think that a simple change of clothing and 
crimson blush from crushed red plants would make her look so much more 
beautiful. Wow... My mom’s got perfect genes. She’s like, an absolute beauty. 

“Mom, sit down. I’ll braid your hair too.” 

“No need. I would stand out too much if you did my hair like that. Tuuli and 
the other children are the stars of the show here, not me.” 

“...Okay.” My intention wasn’t to make her stand out, and I didn’t think 
braided hair would change Mom’s look that much, but oh well. I didn’t know 
what the other dresses would look like and there was the chance that I went too 
far. I jumped off the chair I had been standing on to braid Tuuli’s hair. “Okay, 
let’s go.” 

I took my tote bag to bring to the gate and left home with Tuuli. Dad, 
wearing his work clothes, and Mom went with us. Mom could normally walk at 
a steady pace no matter what she was carrying, but today she walked down the 
stairs slowly while holding her skirt up with her hands to prevent herself from 
accidentally stepping on it. Tuuli learned from her example and lifted up her 
skirt a bit while taking each step. Thanks to that, I somehow managed to be 
faster than them and exited the building first for the first time in my life. 

“Wooow...” 

There were tons of people in the plaza surrounding the well. I heard that the 
entire city celebrated the baptism together. Lutz and Ralph, who had finished his 
baptism in the spring, were both outside despite having nothing to do with the 
event. Our neighbors were coming out to congratulate the stars of this season’s 
baptism. I had always been too sick to go outside much, so today was the first 
one I had ever seen. 

“Congrats, Fey.” 

“Looking a lot more manly, dude.” 

The pink-headed Fey had his baptism today as well, it seemed. He was 
wearing white clothes with green embroidery just like Tuuli, and his shirt was 
held in place by a diagonal green sash. 

Okaaay, I get it. Right. Now I see why being good at sewing is important. All 
these clothes were home made, so one’s skills were being put right on display. 
Sewing skills were never that important in Japan, and even in this world I wore 
raggedy clothes most of the time, so I never understood it when Mom told me 
that being good at sewing was required to be a beauty. 

I never knew since I didn’t have a point of comparison until now, but my 
mom really was great at sewing, I could see why she was so proud of herself. I 


hate working with needles, so I guess I’m pretty much guaranteed to never find a 
boyfriend or get married here. 

“Wow, Tuuli! You’re so cute!” Lutz’s mother, Karla, slapped her cheeks with 
overwhelming surprise after seeing Tuuli and complimented her in such a loud 
voice everyone in the plaza heard. Immediately, everyone’s attention fell on 
Tuuli and words of praise flew in from every which way. 

“Congrats, Tuuli.” 

“Your hair’s all braided and it’s super cute, like a princess’s.” 

Tuuli blushed with embarrassment at Karla’s praise and smiled. Her white 
dress and green hair, with the light forming a halo on it due to the style of my 
braid, fluttered around her. Mmm... Our Tuuli really is an angel. I can tell why 
Dad’s such an obsessive parent. 

“Myne worked hard to braid it for me.” 

“Oh goodness, Myne did that? To think she’s good at something other than 
weird cooking.” 

Mrs. Karla... That’s just mean. Despite feeling depressed on the inside, I was 
a little relieved too. I might have been totally useless around the house, but I did 
have some skills that even this world valued. 

“This looks really complex. How do you tie it together?” 

“Let me see too!” 

Women and girls of all ages peered toward Tuuli’s hair. Aaaah! They’re just 
simple braids, don’t stare at them! I didn’t have a proper comb, so the parting 
lines are kinda messed uuuup... 

“That’s so nice, Tuuli. My baptism’s this winter, I wish I could have my hair 
braided like that too.” 

Once one girl let out a jealous sigh, cries of agreement rung out. People just 
kept saying “me too, me too” with no end in sight. 

“Myne, everyone wants you to do their hair. I think that’s a great idea.” Tuuli 
happily suggested that I braid everyone’s hair, but I shook my head immediately. 

“I couldn’t.” 

“Why not?” 

“I could get sick at any moment. This is the first time I’m even seeing a 
baptism, remember?” 

I hated to disappoint Tuuli, knowing that she wanted to show off her little 
sister, but I didn’t want to braid the hair of a bunch of girls I didn’t know each 
baptism. In the first place, none of them would end up with braids like Tuuli’s. 
None of them took proper care of their hair, just like Tuuli didn’t before I came 


around. I especially didn’t want to start cleaning and maintaining the dirty hair 
of strangers I didn’t know. 

“Oh, okay. You’re healthier now, but we really can’t tell when you’ll get sick. 
That’s too bad, I wanted everyone to know how amazing you are.” 

I really wanted to grant Tuuli’s request since I was generally a useless waste 
of space, but this was physically and emotionally impossible for me. 

“...I could braid your hair while they watch, at least. But I won’t promise to 
braid their hair myself.” 

“Yeah, okay! Dad always says not to make promises you can’t keep, right? 
Everyone! Myne said she could teach you all how to make braids like this!” 
Tuuli, satisfied with my compromise, went ahead and planned a future gathering 
by the well where I would show them how to do the braid. 

I really hadn’t expected my simple braids to get so much attention. Now I 
knew why Mom declined to have hers braided too. 

“So, what about that hair ornament? Who made that?” 

“Myne.” 

“No, Tuuli. Our whole family did! Mom and I made the flowers. Dad made 
the hair stick part.” 

Lacework was so rare that even Mom didn’t know about it despite being such 
a talented seamstress. The older ladies here were fascinated by it. 

“Hey, Myne. Would you teach them how to make these too?” 

“I could, but they’d need to make thin needles first. Plus, Mom would be a 
better teacher than me. I’m not as good at sewing as she is anyway.” 

I wasn’t the most social person out there, and I ran the risk of saying 
something weird due to my lack of familiarity with this world. Who knew what I 
should and shouldn’t say to the moms around here. It would be best to just keep 
my distance and avoid accidentally exposing myself somehow. 

Clang, clang, clang... The temple’s bells rang three times. Whenever the 
temple in the middle of the city rang its bells, the ringing echoed throughout the 
entire city. All of us who’d been making noises around the well fell silent for an 
instant. And then, someone let out a cheer. “It’s time! Let’s go to the main 
street!” 

With the kids being baptized in the lead, we walked onto the main street and 
saw other groups all doing the same from other alleys. A group of kids wearing 
white clothing was going from the edge of town to the temple in the center. The 
group walking consisted of those being baptized and their family, with everyone 
else watching from the sides of the street.
