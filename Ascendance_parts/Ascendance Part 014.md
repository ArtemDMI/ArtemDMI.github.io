There were three new apprentices this season, all whom had been baptized 
along with Tuuli. Otto was pretty busy since he had to go back to square one 
with them, teaching the letters and numbers themselves. Especially since he had 
to finish up his normal work after teaching them. 

While practicing words and doing calculations, I kept an eye out for a good 
opportunity to talk. Once Otto found a good place to stop in his paperwork and 
started putting up his ink, I struck. 

“Mr. Otto, do you mind if I ask a question?” 

“Go ahead.” 

“How do you become a traveling merchant?” 

“Wha?! Myne, do you want to become a traveling merchant?! Wha?! Hold 
on! Did I inspire you by accident? The captain’s gonna kill me!” yelled Otto, 
leaning forward across the desk with his eyes opened wide. He was so surprised 
even I kinda panicked a little. 

I hurriedly waved my hands and corrected him. “Not me, my friend.” 

“Oh, whew. Tell them they should give it up.” 

“I knew it.” 

Otto’s reply confirmed to me that people did not approve of becoming a 
traveling merchant. 

“What do you mean, you knew it?” Otto narrowed his eyes. 

I replied, thinking about how best to explain my perspective. “Ummm, my 
friend is also really quiet and stealthy whenever talking about this, so I figured 
he expected people to shoot him down if he mentioned it.” 

“Yeah, his parents would get super pissed.” 

“Plus, traveling merchants live on the road, right? They have to travel the 
world while thinking about what to buy and sell when and where. Normal 
parents couldn’t give their kids the tools and experience you would need to 
survive that lifestyle, not to mention them not having any important connections 


with merchants, so an average kid wanting to become one would probably have 
a really hard time...” 

I could understand why children of commoners stuck in one city would find 
themselves attracted to the idea of a nomad lifestyle. But the lifestyle is so 
different that their own life experience wouldn’t prove very useful, which would 
make the work harder than they might think. It’d be day after day of doing what 
you thought was right and being punished for it without understanding why. You 
might think it best to do nothing at one point, but then you might get punished 
for doing nothing. 

There was no manual for the unspoken rules one picked up through their 
daily life. I knew very well how large the walls of common sense could be given 
my experience of being suddenly transported to another world where I didn’t 
know right from wrong. But I couldn’t just lock myself up inside my room 
without books, so I was forced to go outside, where I was probably doing a lot of 
really weird, noticeably wrong things. I knew that. 

“If you’ve figured that much out yourself, why don’t you take care of this?” 

“Mmm, I think he’ll listen to you more than me, since I live in the same city 
as him. Plus, I heard this from Dad, but don’t you have connections to the 
Merchant’s Guild? Becoming a traveling merchant might be out of the question, 
but maybe he could become an apprentice merchant and leave the city to buy 
goods elsewhere.” His family probably wouldn’t protest as much if he was 
leaving the city as part of his stable job, rather than him leaving on a 
directionless adventure into the unknown. 

“I see your point. Judging from your tone, I’m guessing you like this boy, 
Myne?” Otto grinned, amused at the prospect of having sniffed out some 
romance, but I just shrugged. 

“It’s not that I like him, it’s just that he helps me out a lot. Nothing good will 
come from letting favors pile up.” 

“A boy who helps you a lot, huh? Must be that gold-haired kid, I guess.” Dad 
was paying Lutz to keep track of my walking pace and report back to him when 
we passed through the gate, so Otto had probably seen him before. 

“That’s right. But you’re so busy training new recruits, Mr. Otto, that I guess 
you might be too busy...” 

“I’ve more spare time this season than any other, so sure, no problem. How 
about we meet up on my next day off?” 

“Thank you, Mr. Otto!” But if this season was the least busy for him despite 
all the work he had, I could only imagine how busy he was when I helped him 


with the budget reports and whatnot. I didn’t really want to think about it, 
considering how I was now his assistant. 

“Ah! Right, there’s something else I wanted to ask. Would you be okay with 
sharing some ink with me?” 

“You mean this stuff?” Otto, with furrowed brows, tapped the top of the shut 
ink jar. I nodded hard, seeing the ink swash behind the clear glass. 

“Could you pay me in ink from now on, not slate pens?” 

“Three years of working for free. No getting paid up front.” His reply was so 
brisk I just blinked it surprise, not understanding what he had said. I briefly 
hoped I had just misheard him, but Otto began counting on his fingers with a 
serious look in his eyes. 

“Your pay will go up if you become an official apprentice, but at the rate 
you’re helping me now, it’ll take about three years to afford a jar of ink, even 
including the bonus pay for budget season.” 

“Three years?! Ink’s expensive!” 

Otto, seeing my surprise, gave a wry grin. “Looks like I need to start teaching 
you the words we use in budgets. Think about it. Ink’s only used for paperwork 
involving nobles, right? It’s way too expensive for kids to play around with.” 

In short, ink was simply out of my reach. Okay. I get it. 

Although I had finally finished the mokkan, I could only weep in despair, as I 
had nothing to write on them with. “Ngggh! The second I solve my paper 
problem, I realize I have an ink problem! What’s with this!” 

Naturally, there were no ball point pens, mechanical pencils, or even ink sold 
anywhere near me. I could use a pointed stick to write with if I just had ink, but 
that ink was too expensive for me to buy. I roughly knew the market value of a 
slate pencil, but since I didn’t know how much the bonus pay for budget season 
was, I couldn’t calculate how much ink was worth. 

...How much money would working for three years straight even be? With 
buying, finding, asking, stealing, and making being my methods of obtaining 
ink, I could only consider making as a legitimate possibility. Nothing good 
would come from me trying to steal ink from the work room... 

It seemed that I would have to start from scratch making both books and ink. 
But how do you make ink, anyway? I knew about mixing pigment with drying 
oil, but where could I find pigment and drying oil in this world? 

“Am I going to have to catch a (squid) or an (octopus)? Where’s the 
(ocean)?!” I let out a yell with a half-finished mokkan in hand, causing Lutz to 


jerk in surprise and spin around. 

“What’s with that?!” 

“Lutz, what do you think this place’s ink is made from?! How can I make 
some myself?!” Naturally, I knew that it wouldn’t be realistic to try and capture a 
squid or octopus. But I had no idea what around me could be used to make ink. 

“Y’know, what even is ink?” 

“Mmm, a black liquid that you use to write letters on stuff, and...” It was hard 
to explain ink to someone who wasn’t used to seeing it. I just said what came to 
mind, and eventually Lutz replied while rubbing his chin. 

“Black stuff? If you just wanna get stuff dirty like that, why not use soot or 
ashes or something?” 

“That’s a great idea! Let’s try it!” Burnt firewood left behind plenty of soot 
and ashes, so I could get what I needed at home. We would even be burning 
wood today. There was no doubt I could get my hands on ashes immediately. 

Upon getting home, I immediately asked Mom for permission. 

“Mom, can I use these ashes?” 

“No, dear. We use ashes to make soap, melt snow, dye things, and so on. 
They’re very useful, and we can even earn money selling them to farmers. Don’t 
take any without permission.” 

Speaking of which, I did remember helping my parents spread ash. I had just 
thrown it everywhere like a granny feeding birds. Who knew that was actually 
intended to help the snow melt. That’s news to me. 

...Mmmm, we used a lot of it when making soap, too, so ashes really are 
valuable. It seemed unlikely I would receive permission to use ashes when they 
could sell the leftovers, but there was one option still left open to me. 

“Well, Mom. What about the soot?” I listed my secondary choice, and after 
furrowing her brows for a second, Mom smiled for some reason and said okay. 

“I don’t know what you intend to use it for, but consider all the soot yours. 
This means you’ll clean the hearth for me, right? And just saying, you’ll get 
more if you clean the chimney too.” 

“Bwuh?! Aww... Okay. I guess that makes sense...” Pushed on by my smiling 
mom, I ended up cleaning the hearth and chimney. This hadn’t been my 
intention, but I had to do what I had to do. I took some cleaning tools in hand 
and pumped myself up to clean some soot... when suddenly my mom stopped me 
in a panic. 

“Hold it, Myne! Are you planning to clean in those clothes?!” 

“...Wha? Should I not?” My clothes were already filthy and in tatters, so I 


didn’t see the problem with cleaning in them. Mom grabbed her sewing box and 
a basket of rags while I watched on with confusion. 

“Wait one moment, I’ll be done in no time.” Mom sewed some rags together 
and made me a new outfit, looking pleased when she finished. I changed into it, 
putting my hair up in an adult fashion to minimize contact between it and the 
dirty rags, though I wore another rag on my head as a bandanna. Wooow. This 
would suck really bad if I weren’t fooling myself into thinking I’m cosplaying 
Cinderella. 

First, I scraped out soot from the hearth. I then stuck my head inside of it and 
scraped off the soot stuck to the sides. It was perhaps the first time the tiny size 
of my body had been useful. 

Unable to resist my mother’s smile, I cleaned the chimney while I was at it 
and got soot from it as well. Black stuff fell out in clumps as I cleaned, steadily 
giving me more of the soot I wanted. 

It honestly got kind of fun once I started, but that led to too much excitement. 
I got a fever and collapsed. 

I had worked so hard that I ended up filthy and unconscious, but I had 
somehow gotten the soot I needed. And now I was healthy again. I just had to 
somehow turn the soot into something I could write with. 

“Myne, what are you gonna do with this stuff?” 

“Mix it with water, I guess?” 

The first thought that came to mind was dissolving the soot in water. I got the 
feeling that would make something like ink. Somehow. I put some river water in 
a wooden bowl and used a stick to mix it with soot. The soot just floated in the 
water without dissolving. 

“Maybe that’s enough?” 

“Try writing something with it.” 

I took a stick with a shaved-down tip and stuck it into the water, then tried 
writing the number “1” on the mokkan. But most of the soot just stuck to the 
stick instead of the mokkan, and the resulting number was too blurry to read. 

“Nooope. This one’s a bust.” 

“What’ll you try next?” 

“Mmm, ink making is built around the idea of mixing stuff with oil, but...” 

I couldn’t ask Mom for oil here. The reason being, our household was always 
short on oil since we used it for eating and for making my simple all-in-one 
shampoo. On top of that, we used animal oil for candles and soap, so it would be 


a hard battle to get any of that. They would probably shoot me down as easily as 
Mom shot me down over the ashes. 

“Needing oil’s rough. I’m guessing they don’t give you any?” 

“Nope, none. I wish there was something...” I searched my memories for a 
hint and plenty of writing utensils used in Japan came to mind. “Mmm, I think 
the (paint) in (Japanese art) used (glue), but that’s out of the question for me, 
since fire’s too dangerous. It really sucks being so small and weak.” Getting glue 
might be more feasible in the future, but not now. That was unfortunate, because 
I would have been able to make something like paint with natural materials. I 
had no choice but to wait for my own growth. 

“Helloooo, Myne, you alive in there? Come back to me.” I could see Lutz 
waving his hands in front of my eyes, but I was too busy thinking to stop. 

“Mmmm, I guess it doesn’t have to be a liquid. (Crayons), (chalk), (pencils)... 
oh, that’s it! Clay! I’ll mix it with clay!” 

“Wha?” 

“I feel like (pencil lead) was made from mixing (graphite) with clay. Wait, or 
maybe that was for (conte sticks)? Well, whatever. I’m using soot instead of 
(graphite), but it just might work!” I could mix clay and soot, squish it all into 
thin cylinders, then dry them. Once they hardened, I might have some solid 
writing utensils. “Lutz, this is where you dug out the clay for the tablets, right?” 

“Yeah, but you may as well just use the leftovers from back then. They 
should be around that rock over there.” 

Lutz was right, there was a small mountain of clay over there. I took some of 
it and mixed in the soot. I was imagining a colored pencil where the whole thing 
was color, or a pencil made entirely of lead. It wouldn’t turn into a usable color 
if I didn’t knead it myself, so both the rock I was using as a base and my two 
hands turned pitch black as I molded the stuff into the shape of a soot pencil. I 
then split it into chunks about as long as a pencil each. If these dry and harden, 
it’ll be my win. 

I washed my hands and feet in the river, but they didn’t get much cleaner. But 
filth this persistent would definitely be good for writing. Definitely. 

“How long do you think I should dry them?” 

“Meh?” 

“Maybe I should try cooking them.” 

“Don’t bother. They’ll explode again.” 

“Awww...” 

I followed Lutz’s advice and quietly let the soot pencils dry on their own. 


Intense Battle with Food 


Due to Tuuli having started working, it became my job to prepare meals. But 
it was impossible for me to make a meal entirely by myself, considering that I 
couldn’t properly hold a knife nor make fires. In the end, I just made the food 
with Mom, helping where I could. 

I wanted to take this opportunity and use it to prepare the food in a Japanese 
style. Unfortunately, despite getting pumped up to use my Urano-era knowledge, 
nothing came from it. Because I mean, the game was rigged from the start. There 
was no rice here. No miso. No soy sauce. Naturally, no store sold mirin or sake. 
There was nothing I could do without ingredients. What could I make out of 
nothing? 

...And hey, I do know how to make miso and soy sauce, okay? I know what 
they’re made of and all that. Soybeans, koji, and salt. I even learned how to put 
them together. Back in elementary school I went on a field trip to a miso factory, 
and the demonstrations they held were so interesting I ended up researching 
more on my own in the library. 

I thought back to that field trip. After doing my absolute best to organize the 
recipes for miso and soy sauce, I wrote a report with my supplementary research 
included. My teacher was so proud she put it up on display in the classroom. 

...But where are soybeans and malt in this world? Even if it were possible to 
replace soybeans with another kind of common bean in this world, where could I 
buy koji? Naturally, I was too afraid to make koji through natural means. After 
all, koji is mold. One simple mistake and my whole family would have food 
poisoning. And even if I found some existing koji, I wouldn’t want to ferment it 
in this bacteria-filled house, not to mention that it would stink so bad my parents 
would throw it away before it’s done. 

I gave up on making my own seasoning and tried hard to think of Japanese 
food that didn’t need seasoning. Mmm... What about sashimi? Maybe it’d taste 
good dipped in salt and fruit juice? But I think this city is really far from the 
ocean. There are no fresh fish in the market. They don ’t even sell wakame or any 
other kind of seaweed. Forget sashimi, I can’t even make a seaweed salad. 

No ocean meant no kelp, naturally. No dried shrimp, no fish flakes. Without 


those ingredients, I had no way of making the dashi soup stock that Japanese 
food needed. That was just a critical problem with no solution. I knew things 
were different here; I wouldn’t ask for powdered soup stock or anything like 
that. But at least give me kelp or fish flakes. 

I did try making something similar to pickles with faux-cucumbers and wine, 
but without soy sauce or sugar, it just didn’t taste right. It ended up painfully 
sour and unlike any pickled food I knew. Being incapable of making anything 
was naturally getting frustrating, so I pieced together the most simple recipe for 
a child like me to make and tried eating the faux-cucumbers with salt rubbed in. 
The salt drew out some of the water from the faux-cucumber and gave it a nice 
salty flavor, resulting in something similar to Japanese pickles. I had thought that 
eating anything similar to Japanese food would satisfy me, but in reality, it just 
made me yearn for white rice even more. Incidentally, eating the salted faux- 
cucumbers with multigrain bread felt so wrong that I couldn’t handle it. 

Rice, rice, Japanese food! Someone! Bless me with Japanese food, please! 
The faux-cucumbers made me want to eat proper Japanese food so much that I 
got it in my head to fish at the river and do what I could there. Since I couldn’t 
use fire, my only choice would be to dry the fish beneath the sun. Dried fish 
might work. Maybe it would work out if I salted the fish before drying them. I 
really hoped it would work out. 

“Hey, Lutz. I want to try fishing. Are there fish in this river?” I asked Lutz by 
the river the next day we went to the forest. 

“I think that’ll be too hard for you.” 

Lutz’s prediction came true when my attempt at fishing failed spectacularly. 
Fishing itself was just really hard. I slumped over, depressed, and Lutz brought 
me a fish. 

“Here, I caught one. Whaddya wanna do with it?” 

“You don’t mind if I have it?” 

“Nah. I don’t need a fish.” 

“Can you start a fire? I want to cook this with salt.” 

Unable to wait for the sun, I took the fish Lutz caught for me and cooked it 
over a fire with salt, like one would cook a trout. 

...Ugh, it stinks! It tastes so bad! One bite later and I was scrunching my face 
up. Weird. It tasted and smelled like stinky mud, unlike any fish I had eaten 
before. Why did this fish smell so bad? I tilted my head, searching through my 
memories to see if I had cooked it wrong as Lutz furrowed his brows. 


“Won’t it stink if you cook it wrong like that?” 

“...It does stink.” The fish just smelled bad. I wish he had told me that earlier. 

I got another fish from him and this time I prepared it with my knife. It didn’t 
work exactly like a Japanese kitchen knife, so the fish got kind of messed up, but 
that shouldn’t impact the flavor. I took a carved stick and stabbed the fish with it, 
then tried drying it. Maybe dried fish would taste better. 

I went to gather firewood while the fish dried, and before I knew it the fish 
had gotten so hard it was inedible. Too much of its water had evaporated. 

“Myne, the heck is this?” 

“...Dried food that got too dry. I don’t think we can eat it anymore.” 

“Yeah, doesn’t look edible to me.” 

“But I might be able to get some soup stock out of it. I’ll try taking it home 
with me.” Even if I couldn’t eat the fish itself, it could potentially serve as a 
good ingredient for soup stock. I took the hard fish home with me and tried 
putting it in water. 

“Myne, what is that?! Disgusting! Please don’t put things like that in our 
pots!” 

“Um, Mom. I want to make soup out of it.” 

“No! The only thing you can put in our pots is food.” 

But this is food, technically. 

The dried fish looked so gross that Mom gave it a hard no, rejecting my idea 
to make soup from it. Maybe it looked so gross to her because she didn’t 
normally eat fish, and a dissected dried one just looked terrible. Kind of 
hypocritical, since she can look at a split-open pig’s head and think it looks 
delicious. 

...I’m sorry, Mr. Fish. I couldn’t make Japanese food in the end. For now, I’ll 
just try and think of how I can use our existing ingredients to make something 
closer to Japanese food in appearance and taste. That seems like it’ll be more 
fruitful than this. Uh huh. 

In a stroke of luck, we were given a bird to eat today. One of our neighbors 
had bagged five birds in the forest, apparently. And since it’d be hard for his 
family to eat all of them before they went bad, he split them with us, partially as 
thanks for us splitting some meat with them when Dad similarly hunted too 
much in the past. 

Mom was cutting up the bird. I didn’t know what species it was. The knife 
she used for cutting meat was so heavy that neither I nor Tuuli could use it yet. 


“Myne. Come now, pick the feathers.” 

“R-Right...” I grabbed the feathers of the bird and pulled. The sensation of 
the feathers popping out gave me goosebumps. I kept pulling the feathers while 
weepily reminding myself that it was necessary if we wanted to eat. It would be 
a long time before dealing with dead animals didn’t bother me. But if I do say so 
myself, I think I’ve grown a lot, considering that I didn’t scream or pass out at 
the sight of Mom gutting the bird. 

“Now, Myne. It’s time to cook.” 

“Okay.” While we were at it, I thought about making broth from the bird’s 
bones. Bird bone broth would definitely alter the range of the food’s flavors. It 
would be no replacement for kelp or fish flakes, but it could go well with dried 
mushrooms. 

However, it was a real struggle to get that bird bone broth. Mom didn’t 
understand what I was trying to do and thus wouldn’t help me at first. In these 
parts it was normal to just cook the meat and eat it plain off the bone. I managed 
to convince her to at least chop the bones, though, by reminding her that today 
was my turn to cook. Everything else was up to me. 

I threw bird bones, tenderloin, and herbs into our biggest pot. I chose herbs 
which smelled and tasted similar to what I was used to despite looking different. 
The ones I used smelled or tasted of onion, ginger, garlic, and bay leaf. Really, I 
put in anything that seemed like it would help cover the smell of the meat. 

“Myne! Wait! That one's too much for you. It's dangerous!” Mom stopped me 
before I could cut the leaves off a white radish-looking thing. She took the knife 
and, as if to stop it from running away, grabbed onto its leaves and held it against 
the cutting board. The moment she glared at the white radish and sharply and cut 
in half, I heard a loud scream. From the radish. 

“Bwuh? What?” I blinked in surprise, wondering if I were just imagining 
things, when Mom let go of the leaves and slammed the flat part of the knife 
against it. She had crushed it just like you would crush garlic. Mom was faster at 
chopping up vegetables than me, so I was thankful for her help, but I noticed that 
the white radish was turning red beneath her knife for some reason. It looked 
scary, like blood pooling out. 

“That should be enough. Be sure to wash it before you use it.” 

Is it just me, or does Mom look a lot more dangerous than the radish? It’s 
probably just me. Let’s leave it at that. In this world, a lot of vegetables that 
looked familiar to me were actually bizarre and incomprehensible. Each time I 
encountered one of these weird vegetables I was reminded that I really was in a 


world different from my own. 

A lot had happened, but once the seasoning herbs were inside the pot, all I 
had to worry about was getting out the scum that would build up. I had heard it 
was best to just dump all the water once you got it boiling, then refill it with 
water, but the scum didn’t actually impact the soup’s flavor and doing all that 
would be tedious, so I didn’t bother. Once it was boiling, I kept an eye on just 
the tenderloin and took it out once it was ready. I dipped it into water, shredded 
it, and that was that. It was ready to be put on the side of some salad.
