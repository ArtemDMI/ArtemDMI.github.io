“I know why you only want to use the seed for oil, but I don’t know how 
much of it I’ll need. I can’t wait that long. I’ll get oil from the rest of the meryl 
too.” 

With that declaration made, I wrapped the meryl in the cloth as instructed and 
started hitting it with the hammer on top of the metal stand. The hammer was so 
heavy I could barely lift it, but after some hard work I felt the fruit gradually 
breaking apart. Wow... Am I maybe amazing? 

“Is this how it’s done? Eheheh.” I squeezed the cloth to get the oil out, 
twisting it with lots of enthusiasm. A dark stain spread throughout the cloth. But 
that was all. A single drop of oil dripped through, but there seemed to be exactly 
no chance of me getting as much oil as I needed. 

“Myne, that’s not good enough. Your aim is bad, you’re not hitting it hard, 
and your swinging posture is all wrong. You crushed the fruit, but the seed’s 
definitely not broken at all.” 

“Awww... Tuuuuulii...” I did my best, but it just wasn’t enough... I looked at 
Tuuli for help, and she took the hammer from me after sighing in exasperation. 

She tightened her grip around it and lifted it up high. Slam! Slam! With each 
heavy thud, the fruit and seed were crushed much faster and more thoroughly 
than when I hit them. “Dad can use juicing weights to get lots of oil without 
using a hammer, but they’re too heavy for us, so we have to break up the fruit bit 
by bit like this.” Apparently, growing boys became entrusted with work for 
adults once they became strong enough to use juicing weights. 

“Once the seed’s completely crushed, you just squeeze the cloth like this, 
and...” The cloth had only gotten damp for me, but once Tuuli started squeezing, 
oil dripped steadily out of it into the small bowl below. I felt my respect for 
Tuuli grow three sizes as I watched the oil build up. 

“Wooow! Tuuli, you’re amazing! Thank you!” 

“Remember to clean up once you’re done, Myne. Come on, clean up.” 

I mean... I don’t know what you mean by clean up, here. After seeing me kind 
of flounder in confusion, Tuuli shook her head and started showing me how. 

She really does like taking care of people, I thought to myself while putting 
the tools away. Once I was done cleaning up, I peered into the bowl of thick, 
white oil and inhaled deeply. The stronger the scent, the better it would be for 
shampoo. 

“Hey, Tuuli. Can I have some herbs too? Whatever smells the best.” 


“Just a little, okay?” 

“Okay!” With Tuuli’s permission, I took out some of the herbs from her 
basket and sniffed them one by one, picking the best ones and crushing them 
between my fingers over the bowl. If I could get their scent into the oil, the 
shampoo would probably end up smelling great. Once the smell carries over, add 
a little salt... 

I started to think about how best to make the shampoo when I noticed Tuuli 
suddenly take the bowl of oil and start carrying it over to where Mom was 
making dinner. 

“Tuuli! No, don’t! What’re you doing?!” I hurriedly snatched the bowl of oil 
away from her and squatted down, holding it close to my stomach protectively. 

Tuuli, seeing that, put a hand on her hips. She was clearly angry. “It’ll be 
ruined if we don’t eat it soon, right? The oil will taste nasty if too much of the 
herb smell gets in it.” 

“You can’t eat this!” I’m going to make shampoo with it, I won’t let anyone 
eat it! No matter what Tuuli said, I had no intention of giving up my one shot at 
making shampoo. I had suffered with dirty hair for too long. 

“Myne! Tuuli went out and gathered those herself! Don’t be selfish!” Mom 
got mad alongside Tuuli, but I had gotten her permission for both the meryl and 
the herbs, so they were mine. They weren’t hers anymore, they were mine. 

“I’m not being selfish! She gave them to me!” I shook my head and prepared 
to defend my oil to the death. My head was so itchy I couldn’t bear it any longer, 
and a way to make shampoo was right in front of me. Nothing would get 
between it and me. 

As if sensing that I wasn’t going to give it up no matter what, both of them 
sighed in exasperation and turned around. I inhaled deeply in relief at having 
protected my oil and mixed a pinch of salt into it. With that, the shampoo 
substitute I had made with my old mom when she got addicted to “natural 
living” was complete. 

“Mom, can I have some hot water?” I laid out a waterproof cloth, usually for 
use when bathing, and put the bowl of oil onto it before bringing a bucket to 
Mom. I had been asking for some of the hot water she made with dinner each 
day, so she nodded and filled the bucket, which I then put on top of the 
waterproof cloth as well. 

I reached out, ready to start washing, but stopped at the last moment. I 
wouldn’t be able to rinse my hair after rubbing the shampoo in like normal, since 
I only had one bucket. How should I do this? 


“Mmm, I guess I’ll just try diluting it first.” My only choice was to dilute the 
shampoo until leaving some of it in my hair wouldn’t be an issue. I haphazardly 
poured the completed faux-shampoo into the bucket and stirred it up. 

“Myne?! What’re you doing?!” 

“Er? Washing my hair?” 

Tuuli looked completely baffled. But given how I hadn’t seen any of them 
use shampoo once since I got here, I could assume that shampooing one’s hair 
wasn’t really a thing in this world, and thus she wouldn’t understand no matter 
what I said. Instead, I would just show her what I’m doing. Seeing is believing. 

I pulled my hairpin out, dipped my hair into the bucket, and began cleaning. I 
mbbed my hair within the water and repeatedly splashed water onto my head so 
that it would get all the way to the roots of my hair. 

Then, I began gently massaging my head. My hands were weak and my arms 
short, which made it difficult. But even so, I repeated the motions until I was 
satisfied before squeezing my hair and wiping my head with a flimsy cloth that 
was a towel in name only. 

After wiping my head several times to get as much shampoo off as possible, I 
ran a comb through my hair. My hair had gotten almost black with filth, but now 
it was closer to its original dark blue color. 

Wow, this is actually looking pretty good. I ran my fingers through my hair 
and sniffed. It smelled slightly of jasmine. My life recently had involved living 
in the midst of body odor reeking of sweat and mud. The mere act of smelling 
something other than my own stink made me a little happy. Mission success. 

“What? Huh? Myne, your hair’s all pretty and dark blue now. It’s like the 
night sky. And your eyes are like moons!” 

Hm... I guess my eyes are gold or yellow, then. Now knowing the color of my 
eyes, I looked at Tuuli’s blue ones and briefly thought about hereditary genetics 
before deciding it would be a fruitless waste of time. 

“Myne, what’s this?” 

“Mmm, it’s (simple all-in-one shampoo). Do you want to try it too? There’s 
enough for us both.” I noticed Tuuli’s curious gaze and gestured her over to the 
bucket. We both slept in the same bed and it’d be better if we were both clean. 
Plus, her pretty face was wasted underneath all that dirt. I wanted Tuuli to be 
clean and maybe this would encourage her to make more shampoo for us. 

“You’re the one who gathered the meryl and herbs, Tuuli, so don’t worry. 

You even squeezed out the oil for me.” 

Tuuli gave a bright smile at my urging and began undoing her braid. She 


must have been watching me the whole time, as she immediately dunked her hair 
in the bucket and began washing it just like I did. 

...Aaah, she’s missing a spot. I stuck a hand into the bucket and scooped up 
some hot water to put on a hard to reach part of Tuuli’s head. Clean, clean, get 
super cleaaan. 

“Tuuli, I think that’ll be enough.” I handed her the rag and she wiped her 
head repeatedly before running a comb through her hair, just like I had done. Her 
green hair had gotten super silky. It rippled down in natural waves that looked 
like they’d been styled, and the light made an angel's halo on the top of her head. 
Basically, her cuteness had multiplied in an instant. 

“Wow, your hair’s super pretty now. And you smell nice.” Mhm. Cute girls 
deserve to be nice and clean. 

Tuuli kept combing her hair as I nodded in satisfaction. We didn’t have 
enough for me to wash her hair every day, but maybe it was now my duty to 
wash her hair every few days and keep it clean. 

I started to clean everything up since we were both done, but Mom rushed 
forward, said “Stop right there,” and started using it herself. 

At this rate, I’m guessing Mom and Tuuli won’t mind me taking some meryls 
to make shampoo with. My goal is to keep my family clean. 

I fell asleep, satisfied at how not itchy my head felt. 

Ever since coming here, the first thing I saw after waking up each day was a 
spider web. I had gotten myself clean, and next I wanted my surroundings to be 
clean. But despite getting all pumped up about cleaning my room, it was too 
much for me. The best I could do with my tiny, weak body was attempt to clean 
my own bed. 

Since Dad had taken the day off, I asked him to dry my blanket on the 
window. “Dad, once the blanket’s dry, can you clean that spider web up?” 

“The spider web? What’s the big deal...?” He was so used to spider webs that 
he didn’t even consider them dirty. 

After a bit of hard thought, I squeezed Dad’s pant leg a little. “I-It’s scary.” 
That wasn’t a lie. If I ever woke up to that spider hanging right above my face, I 
would scream so hard all those present would liken the sound to a miniature Vast 
Glub. Just thinking about it scared me. The sooner that dangerous web was gone, 
the better. 

“You’re afraid of spiders, Myne? Alright then. Let Daddy take care of it.” 

“Yaaay! Thanks, Dad. I’d be really happy if you cleaned around it, too.” 


“Yeah, yeah. You just want all the spooky spiders out, right? Leave it to me.” 

Okay, ceiling done. Dad brushing the ceiling down took down the one 
obstacle I really had no chance of dealing with myself, which meant that from 
now on I just had to do what I could where I could, bit by bit. 

“Mom, where’s the broom?” 

“Right here. Why? Did you spill something?” 

“I want to clean our room.” 

“Okay. If that’s what you want to do, feel free.” 

I gripped the broom and started sweeping it across the bedroom floor. Dust 
puffed into the air. As someone who grew up in a culture where nobody wore 
shoes inside, it was baffling to see a bedroom with a floor so dirty the filth was 
visible. 

I really wanted to sleep in a clean bedroom, no matter what it took. I kept 
sweeping the broom back and forth, pushing a growing mound of dust forward. 
The sweeping itself wasn’t a big issue, since our home barely had anything in it. 

Ngh... I really need to get stronger. Just sweeping a little was enough to make 
my head feel dizzy. I gave up on cleaning for the moment and took a break. At 
this rate, who could say how long it would take until I could live in a clean 
home? 

“Now now, Myne. Why clean the bedroom if you’re going to leave a pile of 
filth by the kitchen? You need to sweep it out the front... Myne, you look sick.” 

Mom peered into the bedroom after seeing the pile of filth I had swept into 
the kitchen and sighed. She then put me into bed and took the blanket out of the 
window to cover me with. “I appreciate the enthusiasm, but you need rest right 
now. If it’s just going to get dirty again, why worry about cleaning it now?” 

Mom... That’s exactly why I need to clean right now. I need to stop it from 
building up. But despite my determination, my body just couldn’t keep up. I was 
stuck lazily cleaning up what little I could each day. I rolled to my side in bed 
and touched my hair after it flowed down in front of my face. 

Well... Now that my hair’s clean, I need to focus on finding paper. 


Neighborhood Boys 


Mom went to work, leaving Tuuli and I alone at home. Naturally, that meant 
Tuuli was the only source of information available to me. 

“Tuuli, do you know where (paper) is sold?” 

“What’d you say, Myne?” 

“I said (paper)... Ah!” 

Tuuli tilted her head, braid shaking, in a gesture that felt very familiar. She 
was making the same expression that she did when my words ended up as 
Japanese and she didn’t understand. I didn’t know how to say “paper” in this 
place’s language. 

Oh no...! I should have asked that pawn stand guy what paper is! “Um, Tuuli, 
you don’t know what (paper) is...?” 

“Sorry. I don’t. The word sounds kinda funny though.” 

My shoulders slumped and I let out a heavy sigh. In truth, finding a store that 
sold paper for books wasn’t my only problem. I didn’t know where to get pens 
or pencils either. Judging from my home and the anachronistic state of the city, I 
doubted I would find any bail-point pens or mechanical pencils anywhere. It was 
very possible fountain pens didn’t even exist yet. 

What, then, should I use as a writing utensil? And how could I get my hands 
on such a utensil? Either way, my most immediate hurdles were my lack of 
money and the physical strength necessary to go searching for materials. Things 
weren’t going to be so easy for me. 

“Aaaah! I can’t believe Dad forgot this!” I heard Tuuli cry out from the 
kitchen and went to investigate. She was holding a wrapped up... something. 

As I recall, Dad had sleepily asked Mom to “get it ready for me, I need it at 
work, ” which ticked her off since she’s always so busy in the mornings and he 
hadn’t warned her at all. She went out of her way to find it for him, and he had 
forgot it. My blood ran cold just thinking about how mad Mom would be if she 
found this out. 

“Tuuli, Mom’s definitely going to get mad, right? Shouldn’t you go get this 
to Dad?” 

“You think so too...? But, I can’t leave you all on your own, Myne...” 


Leave me in my room to go clean dishes, I’ll sneak out of the bedroom and 
start sobbing. Go to the market with Mom, and I’ll pass out. My family’s faith in 
me had hit rock bottom and apparently Tuuli wouldn’t even consider leaving me 
home alone. 

“But Dad will get in trouble without this, won’t he?” 

“...Myne, can you walk all the way to the gate?” Tuuli decided to take me 
with her rather than leave me on my own. I was a little nervous, considering 
what happened when I went to the market, but I was more scared of how mad 
Mom would be. 

I clenched my fist and pumped the air to show my determination. “I-I’ll do 
my best.” 

“Let’s go, then.” 

I put on several layers of clothes, just like I had done when shopping with 
Mom, and left with the bundled something. The layers of clothing weren’t me 
trying to be fashionable; it was entirely an effort to stave off the cold. 
Incidentally, to list all the clothes I owned: two pairs of underwear, two wool 
dresses, a wool sweater, two woolen trouser-esque pants, and two woolen socks. 
When going outside, I wore all of them. 

“Tuuli, this is so heavy I can barely walk.” 

“But you need to wear all of them to cover up all the gaps. Who knows where 
wind will blow from? You get fevers really fast, Myne, so you need to wear 
everything you can.” 

I had hoped that Tuuli would be more forgiving than Mom was, but her 
strong sense of responsibility prevented her from letting me go outside without 
as warm an outfit as possible to keep me safe. I gave up and put everything on, 
but it really did make it hard to move. 

Tuuli didn’t put on nearly as much since she was healthy. Not to mention that 
she had a lot of stamina thanks to her frequent trips to the forest with other kids 
and all the chores Mom gave her to do around the city. 

I lacked both stamina and speed. All I had was the weight of my clothes. 

“Are you okay, Myne?” 

“Haaah, haaah... If, we take, it slow...” Just like last time, I was out of breath 
by the time we reached the bottom of the stairs. That said, I continued to walk at 
my own pace. I’d just make things harder for Tuuli if I forced myself to go fast 
and subsequently passed out. It was important that I slowly build up trust with 
her. 


...Seriously though, it’s really hard to walk on cobblestone. It was bumpy and 
I’d fall right over if I didn’t watch my feet. I took Tuuli’s hand and let her guide 
the way while I directed all my attention to my feet. 

“Huh? Hey, it’s Tuuli! What’re you doing here?” 

I lifted up my head after hearing a boy’s voice sound out from somewhat far 
away. Three boys were racing up to us, carrying baskets alongside bows and 
arrows. Their hair formed a colorful rainbow of red, gold, and pink, respectively. 
It was kinda hard to look away from their heads. 

Their clothes were all light gray, stained with mud and bits of food. The 
faded design on them showed that each of them were wearing hand-me-downs, 
and judging by how similar they looked to what we were wearing, I could guess 
that we were all equally poor. 

“Ah, Ralph! Hey Lutz, Fey!” Tuuli seemed friendly enough, so Myne might 
have spent some time with them in the past. I rubbed my temples and went deep 
into thought, searching her memories. Mmm... Ah, there they are. Huh. I guess 
they live in our neighborhood. 

Ralph was the same age as Tuuli. He had red hair and was the tallest of the 
three. He was something of a leader to the other kids, many of whom viewed 
him as a sort of older brother. 

Fey was also as old as Tuuli. He had pink hair and the face of the most 
mischievous prankster in the world. Likely due to fear of accidentally hurting the 
weak and sickly Myne, he usually kept his distance from her. She didn’t have 
many memories of him. 

Lutz was Ralph’s younger brother and had golden blonde hair. We were the 
same age. He usually tried to act like a tough older brother around Myne, which 
I thought was super cute. Like a kid stretching to look taller. 

Tuuli generally went to the forest with them, and apparently they had brought 
Myne along a few times. Those sparse memories were a lot more clear than the 
other ones. 

While I was digging through my memories, Tuuli was excitedly talking with 
Ralph. “Dad forgot something, so we’re walking to the gate. Are you three going 
to the woods, Ralph?” 

“Yep. Let’s stick together ’till the gate.” 

Tuuli’s beaming smile as she talked to Ralph made it clear that taking care of 
me was a big burden on her. Which made sense; going to the forest with 
everyone was definitely more fun than babysitting me. 

Um... Sorry for being such a bad little sister. But my fever’s been gone for the 


past few days, so I think you’ll be able to go outside soon. By which I mean, go 
outside and help me look for a store that sells paper, if you would be so kind. 

Tuuli’s walking pace shot up the moment she joined Ralph and the others. 
Since we were holding hands, she basically dragged me behind her until I 
tripped. 

“Oh no no no!” Tuuli stopped in front of me, so I didn’t fall completely over, 
but I did end up on my knees. 

“Sorry, Myne. Are you okay?” 

“...Uh huh.” I wasn’t in pain, but it was hard to stand up after getting on the 
ground. I wanted to just go ahead and take a nap. It’s kinda hard to breathe, I 
thought before someone stuck out a hand. 

“Hey, Myne. Want me to carry you?” 

...Lutz, you’re such a good kid! I searched Myne’s memories and saw that 
since Ralph and Fey always treated him like a little kid, he tried acting like a 
tough older brother around Myne despite being the same age. He would carry 
her stuff, protect her whenever she ended up exhausted, and do all sorts of things 
that made him seem like a fine young gentleman with a bright future. Not to 
mention that I was much more familiar with blonde hair than pink or green hair, 
so being around him was mentally calming in a way. 

“Myne, you were sick again recently, weren’t you? It must hurt. I’ll carry 
you.” I appreciated Lutz’s good intentions. But although I was smaller than him, 
he was still my age. I’d feel bad making him carry me, and I was worried he 
might collapse under me. My internal debate over whether or not to accept was 
soon interrupted by Ralph sighing and taking off his stuff. 

“We’ll never get to the forest with Lutz carrying her. Here, Myne, I’ll carry 
you. Lutz, take my bow. Fey can carry my basket.” 

“Ralph...” Lutz glared at Ralph with a little frustration. Maybe he felt like his 
good deed was being swiped away. 

“You worried about me sooner than anyone, Lutz. You’re really nice. Thank 
you. It made me happy.” I smiled brightly and gave Lutz’s hand a squeeze while 
showering him with praise. 

Lutz, seemingly satisfied that someone had recognized what he had done, 
smiled a shy smile and quietly took Ralph’s bow. 

“Alright, c’mere.” 

“Uh huh. Thanks, Ralph.” I walked up to Ralph and crawled onto his back, 
which was somewhat larger than Tuuli’s. It was sad that a boy knew had to carry 
me, but Little girls such as myself had no need for shame. No need! 


Ralph began walking firmly ahead with me on his back. The city looked a lot 
different with an extra forty or so centimeters to my height. To be more specific, 

I was previously spending almost all my time watching the cobblestones beneath 
my feet, but now I could see ahead and look at all the distant buildings. Not only 
that, but since he was walking at his own pace rather than my slow one, the 
buildings were passing by much faster. 

“Wow, so hiiigh! So faaast!” 

“Don’t get too excited, alright? You’ll get sick again.” 

“Uh huh. I’ll be careful.” 

Still though, boys who have to carry firewood home sure end up strong. He’s 
got a lot of muscles for a kid his age. None of my Japanese classmates in 
elementary school looked anything like him. Though that wasn’t a fair 
comparison considering our different living environments and whatever genetic 
differences separated them. 

It was also important that I didn’t compare the city to Japanese locations. I 
shouldn’t judge these people for the filth flowing through the gutters, or how 
their donkeys are pooping while they walk through the street... H-Hey, it’s not 
like I want to look at all this disgusting stuff! It’s all just so different from what 
I’ve seen in Japan that my eyes are drawn to it! 

We must have been passing through a craftsman’s street, since unlike the 
stores near the market, I couldn’t see at all into the first-floor stores. Those that 
just sold goods had glass windows to show off their wares, but the stores around 
here just had a single signpost hanging around the door and nothing else. Not 
only that, but all the buildings looked similar and were the same color. If not for 
that, the filth wouldn’t stand out so much and my eyes wouldn’t have been 
drawn toward it. It’s not my fault! 

“Ralph, are you okay? Myne isn’t too heavy?” asked Tuuli, looking back and 
forth between Ralph and me with a worried look in her eyes. 

Ralph shook himself a little to adjust my position on his back before 
somewhat curtly looking away. “I’m fine. Myne’s so small and light I barely 
notice her. And you’d get in trouble if she got sick from walking, right?” Judging 
by his embarrassed expression and tone of voice, he probably wanted to help 
Tuuli out. Or in other words, he wanted Tuuli to feel gratitude toward him. 

Ohoho, my sweet young Ralph. Are you after my Tuuli? They do say that if 
you want to take down the general, you must first defeat his horse. Mmm, I don’t 
mind being the horse. Keep on growing, young romance! Of course, that could 
have just been my imagination. 


But Ralph then took Tuuli’s braid and smelled it, then said, “Tuuli, I dunno 
why, but you smell pretty good.” 

What are you, the protagonist of a shoujo manga?! I couldn’t help but tease 
them on the inside. I mean, Tuuli replied by saying “Really? Thank you...” while 
blushing. Who could blame me?
