They were both so young I doubted they were actually in love, but in a world 
without books as entertainment, I’d like you to forgive me for fantasizing a bit in 
my head. I hadn’t experienced a trace of romance in my life despite being close 
to graduating college, and yet there was six-year-old Tuuli radiating youthful 
romance. I couldn’t help but have a little fun fantasizing about it. 

I know what you’re thinking, but don’t say it. “Maybe you’d be more popular 
with boys if you didn’t just read books and live in fantasies all day. ” My family 
and even my neighbor Shuu said that exact same thing to me. I don’t wanna hear 
it. Shuu’s just a big dummy. Duuuummy. 

While I was in the middle of remembering the frustrations I felt back as 
Urano, Tuuli and Ralph’s childhood romance morphed into a more advanced 
love triangle. 

“It’s true. You do smell good.” 

“Lemme see.” 

Fey and Lutz both leaned toward Tuuli’s braid and sniffed. If they were all 
boys and girls of the appropriate age, they would be about three steps away from 
battling to the death for Tuuli’s heart. 

“Your hair’s really silky too. What’d you do?” 

Eheheheh. Riiight? Right. Satisfied by the looks of surprise on their faces, I 
nodded repeatedly. 

I was in the process of improving the cleanliness of my home. I dried nice¬ 
smelling flowers and put them in our clothing boxes, I had Mom boil the water 
we used for food before using it to cook, I wiped down Tuuli’s body when we 
“bathed” together, and I brushed her hair after using herb oil on it. It seemed the 
fruits of my labor were already starting to show. 

Although I had gotten a little used to everything smelling bad in this city, 
Ralph and the others still stunk a bit. I wouldn’t say it out loud since Ralph was 
going out of his way to carry me, but I really wanted to scrub everyone down 
with soap. It was a shame that our home only had animal soap for use in 
cleaning furniture and clothes, no plant soap for washing bodies and leaving a 
nice smell. Aaah... I want some nice-smelling soap. 

While I was in the middle of dreaming about a world that didn’t stink, Lutz 


took my hair. He inhaled deeply, as he had done with Tuuli’s. “You smell nice 
too, Myne.” Lutz smiled warmly while looking directly at me with his jade green 
eyes. 

Oh... Oh no! Lutz has a powerful color scheme! Golden blonde hair and jade 
green eyes alone make him look like a super cool, handsome guy! 

“Plus, you look a lot cuter now that you’re pinning your hair back and I can 
see your face better.” 

Hyaaaah! A finishing blow! Even though he’s a little kid, I’m feeling super 
embarrassed! I know he’s not doing it on purpose, but goodness! Please, stop! I 
may be kinda old, but I’ve never experienced anything like this! I don’t know 
what to do! 

I was the only one frozen in place and freaking out. Everyone else was 
already talking about what they wanted to find in the forest, or how long it 
would take for snow to start falling. The fact that Lutz was bragging about 
getting better at archery despite freaking me out like this ticked me off. Tuuli 
managed to just thank him, but I could only freeze in surprise. My heart was still 
pounding. 

...Is it normal for five-ishyear old kids to do things like that here?! Um, 
what’s with this world?! I’m a fine young Japanese maiden with a shy heart, this 
is way too much for me! 


Paper: Unobtainable 


I kicked my legs around while clinging to Ralph’s back and eventually the 
outer wall’s gate came into view. The outer wall protected the city, and up close I 
saw that it was really tall. It was about as tall as a three-story Japanese building 
and was fairly thick. There were gates at the north, east, south, and west sides of 
the outer walls and several soldiers at each one checking those who came inside. 

We had reached the south gate and we could see several of those soldiers. 

One of them should be my dad. I couldn’t tell which was him, but Tuuli could 
somehow. She hugged the wrapped-up thing to her chest and ran toward him, 
waving hard. “Daaaad! You forgot something. You need this, right?” 

Dad blinked in surprise as Tuuli handed him the thing with a bright smile. 
So... So nice. You’re way too nice, Tuuli. All I cared about was avoiding Mom’s 
wrath over him forgetting what she worked so hard to find. 

“Yeah, I do need it. Thanks... Wait, did you leave Myne alone?!” 

“Nuh uh, I brought her with me. See? Ralph carried her on his back.” 

Dad, eyes wavering due to feeling bad about having not noticed me, plopped 
a hand on Ralph’s head. “Thanks for carrying her, Ralph.” 

“We were on our way to the forest anyway.” Ralph lowered me to the ground, 
looking a little annoyed at how Dad was ruffling his hair. He then took back his 
stuff from Fey and Lutz. 

“Thanks, Ralph. You too, Lutz and Fey.” 

After seeing Ralph and the others through the gate on their way to the forest, 
Tuuli and I were taken to a waiting room within the inner gate. 

The outer wall was large enough to fit a room of about nine square meters of 
size inside. It wasn’t that big, but there were apparently other waiting rooms and 
a room for those on night duty too. Our waiting room had a simple table, a 
bench, and a single cabinet with shelves. 

I looked all around, feeling like a tourist in a foreign country, and soon one of 
Dad’s coworkers brought in cups of water for us. “You certainly raised your 
daughters well, I see.” 

It took about twenty minutes for a child like Tuuli to walk from home to the 


gate, so I appreciated the water. I gulped down the water in the wooden cup and 
let out big sigh of relief. “Haaah. That was tasty. Finally, I can rest my sore 
legs.” 

“You barely walked on your own, Myne,” said Tuuli with pursed lips, 
causing everyone to burst into laughter at once. I hmph’d, but since everyone 
had seen Ralph carrying me, I couldn’t say anything back to her. 

As I drank down a second cup of water, a single soldier entered the room. He 
took out a toolbox-looking thing from the cabinet and immediately left. It looked 
like he was in a hurry, so I looked around. “Did something happen out there, 
Dad?” 

“Probably just someone needing special attention at the gate. Nothing to 
worry about.” Dad waved it off, but his hurried behavior did get me a little 
worried. Would things really be okay? I mean, a soldier guarding this gate is 
hurrying around. Doesn’t that spell trouble? 

In sharp contrast to me, Tuuli tilted her head in confusion without looking 
worried at all. “Someone needing special attention? Have I ever seen someone 
like that?” Despite passing through the gate frequently, Tuuli couldn’t 
immediately imagine someone who would make a guard rush that much. 

Dad rubbed his stubble and searched for the right words. “Aaah, yeah. Think 
someone suspicious-looking who’s probably a criminal, or maybe the opposite 
and it’s a noble we need to inform Lord Ehrenfest about before letting them in.” 

“Wow...” Apparently, they just judge people on their looks. Well, I guess 
there’s no helping that. This world doesn’t seem like it would have a robust 
information network or anything of the sort. Soldiers had no way of researching 
the background of anyone coming inside. 

“We have them wait in a separate room while the higher-ups decide on 
whether or not to let them inside.” 

Aaah. So that’s why there are so many waiting rooms by the gate. I get it. I 
bet the waiting room for nobles and the waiting rooms for suspicious-looking 
people are totally different in size and furnishings. 

My thoughts were interrupted after the young-looking soldier with dark 
brown hair and gentle, calm brown eyes came right back carrying the box and 
something rolled up into a tube shape. His expression lacked any sense of 
emergency. Dad was right, it apparently hadn’t been anything that serious. 

The soldier, bundling up the box and roll in his left hand, stood in front of 
Dad and tapped his right fist against the left side of his chest twice. Dad stood 
up, correcting his posture, and repeated the same fist-tapping gesture. That was 


probably the salute of this world. 

“Otto, your report?” 

I let out a tiny awed noise after seeing Dad make a serious expression unlike 
anything I had seen at home. He usually looked so lazy and relaxed it was a real 
change of pace. When serious, he actually looked pretty cool. 

“Count Lowenwalt is requesting entry.” 

“And his seal?” 

“Checked and confirmed.” 

“Alright, let him through.” Otto gave one more salute before sitting in the 
chair on the opposite side of ours. He put the box on the table and spread out the 
roll beside it. It was as smooth as paper and had a distinctive scent that had my 
eyes locked on it. 

...Parchment?! I didn’t know for sure if it was parchment, but it definitely 
looked like paper made from animal skin. I was used to paper made from plants, 
but older paper was often just dried animal skin called parchment. This world’s 
language was written on it, though I couldn’t read the letters. 

As I stared at it with wide-open eyes, Otto took a bottle of ink and a reed pen 
out of the toolbox and began writing something on the parchment. 

AAAAAH! Writing! There’s someone who knows how to write in front of me! 
He’s the first man of culture I’ve met in this world. I definitely want him to teach 
me this world’s lettering system! 

Dad rustled my hair and asked “What’s wrong?” as I stared at Otto’s moving 
hands. 

I looked up at him and pointed at what I believed to be parchment. I had to 
learn what it was called in this world’s language if I wanted to talk about it. 
“Dad, Dad. What’s this?” 

“That’s parchment. Paper made from goat or sheep skin.” 

“And this black stuff?” 

“Ink. He’s writing with a pen.” 

I knew it. I’ve found my ink and paper. I’ll be able to make books with this 
stuff, no problem. 

Holding back the urge to jump with joy, I squeezed my hands together in 
front of my chest and looked up at Dad. “Um, Dad. Can I pleaaaase have them?” 

“No. Those aren’t toys for children.” My full-power begging using all of my 
childhood cuteness was shut down instantly. 

Of course, I wasn’t the kind of girl who would give up after being told no 
once. Back when I was Urano, people said I was the most stubborn and 


persistent person they had ever met. It was time to show Dad just how fierce I 
could be when it came to books. 

“I want to write just like that. I want paper and ink. Pleeease?” 

“No, not a chance! You don’t even know your letters, Myne.” It was true that 
ink and paper was useless to someone illiterate. Which is exactly why Dad’s 
statement was the perfect chance for me. 

“Then teach me. I want to learn. Will you give me ink and paper if I learn?” 

If his young-looking subordinate could write, then Dad could definitely write. 
He was, like, their captain. I didn’t expect anyone in a house with no paper 
would know how to write, but that seemed to be a fortunate misunderstanding on 
my part. My dreams of reading books in this world might come true soon if Dad 
taught me to read. 

As I beamed a bright smile, feeling as if I had taken a giant leap toward what 
I wanted more than anything else, I heard a chuckle. I turned toward its source 
and saw that Otto, who had been listening to us while writing, had burst out in 
helpless laughter. 

“Hahaha! Teach you...? Heh, don’t you barely know how to write, Captain?” 

The moment I heard that, I felt a crack run through my very soul. Even I 
could tell that my smile had frozen in place, as if a bucket of cold water had been 
dumped over me. “Wha? Dad, you don’t know how to write?” 

“I can read and write, a bit. I need to know how to read parts of the 
paperwork I deal with, but that’s it. Best I can do is write down the names I 
hear.” 

“Oh...?” I looked at Dad with cold eyes as he made excuses with a sullen 
expression. So basically, in terms of my original world, he kinda knows the 
alphabet and can write the names of his friends, I guess? Since Otto said 
“barely,” he’s probably like a first grader who’d miswrite even those names. 

“Hey now, don’t look at your father like that.” Otto, the culprit behind my 
respect for Dad shooting up and then immediately dropping down, chastised me 
a bit with a somewhat worried expression. Then, as if covering for Dad, he 
began to explain what kind of work soldiers did. 

“Soldiers work to preserve city peace, but when it comes to important 
business involving nobles, it’s really the knights who take care of the paperwork. 
A simple spoken report suffices for less important incidents, so his work rarely 
involves reading. Just being able to write names is more than enough.” 

Dad puffed out his chest with pride, his mood brightened by Otto’s follow¬ 
up. My cold gaze had cut him surprisingly deep. 


“Rural townsfolk are even worse off. Usually only town chiefs can read at all, 
so your dad’s plenty amazing.” 

“Okay, my amazing dad. I want paper and ink. Pleeease give me them?” If he 
was that amazing, then he should show it by giving his cute daughter about one 
hundred sheets of paper. 

But my begging was met by Dad taking a fearful step back. “Wh-Who would 
dump a whole month’s wages on a piece of paper for their kid?!” 

Wait, what?! A month’s wages? J-Just how expensive is parchment?! I can 
see why he’s so hesitant to give me some now. That also explained why there was 
no paper in our house or why I couldn’t find any bookstores. Parchment was just 
too expensive for commoners. My family was already just barely scraping by; 
there was no way they’d spend their precious wages on paper to make a book. 

I slumped my shoulders, depressed, and Otto ruffled my hair. 

“In the first place, I don’t think that there are any stores that sell parchment to 
commoners. Paper is used by nobles, government officials, and rich merchants 
with connections to nobles. If you just want to learn your letters, why not use a 
stone slate? I can give you the one I used to use a long time ago.” 


“Really?! I’d love it!” I immediately nodded and he graciously promised to 
give me his old slate. While I was at it, I wiggled my way into having him teach 
me. “Thank you, Mr. Otto! I’m so glad you’re going to teach me letters!” 

As I beamed a broad smile, Dad looked between me and Otto with a fairly 
pathetic look on his face, but I pretended not to notice. I was very excited to 
learn letters and own a slate, but what I really wanted was a book and the paper 
to make one. 

After all, you couldn’t store information on a slate. It was like a chalkboard 
that you wrote on then cleaned off. Perfect for learning letters, but nothing 
compared to a book. 

Still, the fact that stores didn’t sell paper to commoners came completely out 
of left field. How could I make books without paper? Or in other words, what 
would I do if I couldn’t get paper? There was only one answer: I would just have 
to make some myself. 

Ngggh, the road to getting a book is so long! 


Learning to Respect Egyptian Culture 


Now, despite resolving to make my own books no matter what, I couldn’t 
manage to procure paper. My Japanese spirit suggested that I go to a department 
store and buy five hundred sheets of copier paper for two hundred yen, but in 
this world, a month of my dad’s wages would disappear buying a single sheet of 
parchment. 

To make a sheet of parchment, one would have to peel the skin off an animal, 
shave off the fur, and then cut the animal-shaped skin into easy to use rectangles. 
The sheet of parchment I saw at Dad’s workplace was about the size of an A4 
piece of paper. No matter how I cut it, I’d get about five to eight smaller sheets 
of paper at best. 

In other words, parchment was so expensive that a poor commoner such as 
myself would never be able to buy a book’s worth of it. To sum things up: 

Before I could make books, I needed to learn to make paper. But the only real 
experience I had with making paper was recycling milk cartons. Everything else 
I had just read about in books. 

You would think learning something from a book would be enough to just do 
it, right? But think hard about that, and you’ll realize that things really aren’t 
that simple. 

As far as I knew, there were no machines in this world for making paper. 
With no machine, I had to do all of the paper-making work by hand. And yet I 
was a sickly girl as weak as a three-year-old. There was little I could do on my 
own. The first step toward making paper was wood, and that alone was already a 
huge hurdle for me. 

In conclusion: It was impossible for me. But it was also too soon to give up. 

Since records were important both economically and politically, Earth had a 
very extensive recorded history. Records were kept for millennia, but it was only 
recently that humans developed machines for making paper. In short, the further 
back in history we went, the more likely it was that I would be able to recreate 
the methods used for recording information. 

Mmm... What did civilizations without machines do...? I opened my hands as 
wide as possible and glared at my palms. Ancient civilizations, ancient 


civilizations... You can’t talk about civilized ancient cultures without mentioning 
Egypt! And you can’t talk about Egypt without mentioning papyrus! Long live 
Egypt! 

Through connecting the dots in my existing memories, I realized that I could 
make faux-papyrus with Egypt as my guide. It was invented in a society about as 
technologically advanced as the one I was in, so perhaps even my small hands 
would be enough to make it. 

It was made using some kind of plant... I wasn’t sure which, but I think it was 
just, like, made from the fibers of especially straight trees and plants... or 
something. 

This world had plants too. I bet if I went to the forest, it’d be filled with 
plants perfect for making into paper. 

...Okay, the forest. Let’s go to the forest. I’m a woman who was both admired 
and lamented by my family and friends for how fast my footwork became when 
books were involved. I act the moment a thought comes to me. 

In this case, I immediately asked Tuuli to take me with her to the forest. 

“Tuuli, I want to go to the forest too. Can I come w — ” 

“Wha?! You, Myne? No way.” 

She shot me down before I even finished. Her reaction speed indicated she 
didn’t even need to think about her answer. And the force of her “no way” 
probably reflected that she wouldn’t budge no matter what I said. Ouch. 

“Why not?” 

“You can’t walk that far, can you? There’s no way you could walk to the 
forest if you can’t even make it to the gate. And once we get to the forest, we 
need to pick up firewood and gather fruit. There’s no time to rest. Plus, you can’t 
climb trees. Could you walk home carrying a lot of heavy stuff while tired? We 
need to make it back before the gate closes, so you couldn’t rest no matter how 
tired you got. See? There’s no way you can go to the forest.” 

Tuuli rattled off all the reasons I couldn’t go to the forest one by one, 
counting on her fingers. There were a lot of reasons, but they could all be 
summed up as “You’re too weak. ” 

“Plus, winter’s coming soon, so there’s less stuff there...” According to Tuuli, 
it was likely that I would exhaust myself reaching the forest and then find 
nothing there I wanted. That would definitely be rough. 

I either had to go to the forest accepting it might be fruitless, or give up on 
making paper. There was no easy way out. 

“What do you want? I don’t think there are many meryls left.” Tuuli tilted her 


head as she thought hard about it. 

As meryls were the main ingredient of my simple all-in-one shampoo, we 
were using all of them for oil without eating any. We would then use the oil to 
moisturize our hair every now and again. I did appreciate all the meryls, but I 
cared more about books than my looks. I needed plant fibers in order to make 
my faux-papyrus. 

“Ummm, are there any (plants with easily removed fibers)?” 

“Huh? What?” Tuuli gave me a confused look. Something I said there had 
definitely been in Japanese. 

Mmm, I thought, and tried to come up with a simpler way of saying that. “...Is 
there a plant with really straight, thick stems? I just want the stems.” 

Tuuli put a hand on her head and thought about my question. Did I ring any 
bells? I waited patiently for her answer. 

After a brief pause, Tuuli shrugged. “I know, I’ll just help Ralph and Lutz 
out.” 

“Wha? You’ll help them, not get them to help us?” I tilted my head in 
confusion, which surprised Tuuli for some reason. 

After blinking multiple times, she said “Haven’t we talked about this before? 
Ralph’s family raises chickens, so they need lots of animal feed to last the 
winter, remember?” 

Um... No, I don’t remember. Tuuli sounded like she was saying things I 
should know, so I replied “That’s true” while hiding my ignorance. 

“Sol was thinking I would try asking them for stems if I help them gather the 
plants and stuff. But the season where lots of plants grow is already over, so I 
don’t think there’ll be many.” 

“That’s fine. Thanks, Tuuli!” 

Just like always, Tuuli’s being a great older sister. I’m so lucky to have her. 

The next day, I went with Tuuli down the stairs and tried asking Ralph and 
Lutz for help. Thankfully they accepted, but I couldn’t leave everything to other 
people. I went on my own quest for plants. 

Luckily, there were plants growing by the well, aside from the paved part. 
Maybe I could use those stems. 

“Mom, I’ll go with you to the well.” 

“Oh my, do you want to help?” 

“Nuh uh. Not that. I want to gather plants.” I showed her the small basket that 
Tuuli had made earlier. 


“Okay, do your best.” I had straight-up declined to help her, but Mom still let 
me go with her, excited that I was healthy enough to be moving around. 

I climbed down the stairs again, this time with Mom carrying a bunch of 
laundry. As that was my third time climbing down the stairs, I naturally ended up 
out of breath by the time I reached the bottom, which left me in no condition to 
be hunting for plants. 

I rested next to Mom as she drew water from the well and rubbed our clothes 
with strongly-smelling animal soap that produced no bubbles whatsoever. Tuuli 
was right. If I didn’t get stronger somehow, I’d never make it to the forest no 
matter how much I wanted plants from there. Isn’t there any way to get this body 
a little stronger? 

“My my, if it isn’t little Myne.” 

“Good morning,” I said. I didn’t recognize her, but a middle-aged woman 
named Carla called out to us sounding friendly. 

“Oh, hello, Carla. Morning. You’re up early.” Mom smiled back and 
continued the conversation, so this was definitely someone Myne knew. But 
who? I searched my memories, making sure not to make it obvious I didn’t 
recognize her. 

Indeed, it was someone I knew. My memories told me it was Ralph and 
Lutz’s mother. She was a somewhat, er, sizable woman that seemed more or less 
dependable.
