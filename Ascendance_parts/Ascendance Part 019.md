“There’s one! Hohwoah! Hohwoah hohwoah!” We discovered a shumil 
eating a ton of rutrebs super fast, his mouth bright red with juice, and 
immediately started mimicking the noises of large animals. The shumil jerked 
and began dashing into the shrubbery. 

“Phiiiiih!” 

“Phih phiiiih!” Other shumils that had been eating nearby also ran off after 
hearing their friend’s squeals. They all ran off at once, spreading apart and all 
mshing to the small hill in hopes of maximizing their chances of survival. 

“Hohwoaaaah!” Fey’s voice rang out from a different angle. The shumil that 
had been running his direction hurriedly changed course. I ran as well, shouting 
to keep the shumils packed together so that as many as possible ran into Ralph 
and Tuuli’s net up ahead. In the end, six shumils ran together in a tight group and 
ran straight into the net. We caught them all without letting a single one escape. 

“Yes!” 

“Alright, let’s go to the river!” 

After stabbing our knives into the net to slice the shumils’ throats and remove 
their talons, we took them out of the net and dragged them by their back feet to 
the riverbed. The talons on a shumil’s front feet were poisonous, so we chopped 
them off preemptively to be safe. 

You only hunt as many animals as you can carry home. Ralph and Fey could 
carry two, but that was still too hard for me, so I guessed I would just be 
carrying one. Same went for Tuuli. Even while being dragged to the river, those 
shumils that hadn’t finished dying flailed and struggled, trying to attack with 
their front legs. I tightened my grip so that mine couldn’t run away. 


When we reached the river, we began butchering them. I felt a pulse in my 
shumil and let out a sigh of relief. If it had died, the stench of blood would have 
seeped into the meat more. The faster I could bleed its meat, the better. 

“Be careful,” warned Ralph. Everyone nodded as we readied our knives. 
Shumil were feybeasts: magical creatures. If we didn’t butcher them carefully, 
our knives would hit the hard stone known as a mana crystal within their bodies, 
and the moment they did the shumil would melt and disappear. 

We all smacked the shumils’ heads with the handles of our knives to knock 
them out before stabbing their lower stomachs and drawing the knives upward. 

“Kyaaah! I messed up!” Tuuli, looking pitiful, watched her shumil melt into a 
dark, thick liquid. She then took the mana crystal out of the dark liquid and 
washed it in the river, shoulders slumped in sorrow. 

“Tuuli, you can have one of mine. Butcher this one and take it home,” offered 
Ralph, pointing toward one of the shumil he had brought with him. 

“Really? Thanks, Ralph. You can have this mana crystal, then.” Tuuli, 
resolving not to mess up this time, delicately slid in her knife. 

Fey gave a mean smirk. “That shumil kinda looks like Myne, huh? They’re 
both blue and stuff.” 

“No they don’t! Shut up, you’re making this hard for me!” Tuuli resisted 
Fey’s bullying and safely finished her butchering, removing the shumil’s organs 
and washing the blood off them. 

“Think about it. Myne and shumils are both super weak, right? But when 
they get mad their eyes get all rainbowy and stuff. What’s the difference?” 
Shumils normally just ran away, but if parents saw you kill their children, their 
eyes shined like rainbows and they charged you down. Fey said that was just like 
what Myne did when she got mad. It was true that when Myne got truly mad, her 
eyes narrowed and her atmosphere totally changed. Then, her normally golden 
eyes would start changing colors, as if a layer of oil had covered them. 

“That was your fault for getting her mad, Fey. You stomped all over those 
clay tablet things she worked hard to make.” I glared at Fey as I got ready to 
leave. I had finished butchering my one shumil, but he was just getting started on 
his second. 

“I didn’t think she’d get that mad... Gah! Crap, I messed up.” Thoughts of 
Myne’s anger had apparently messed with Fey’s focus while he was cutting. He 
clicked his tongue at the sight of the black pool of once-shumil beneath him and 
then, sighing, took out the mana crystal to wash off the blood. 

“Hey Futz, go home early with Fey and sell this at that crystal store. Me and 


Tuuli gotta stay here to watch the little kids.” 

“Got it.” I caught the mana crystal Ralph threw at me and started going home 
with Fey. We had to get back to the city before the store that bought mana 
crystals closed. 

We took our shumils, which had finished bleeding, and fastened them to 
suitable branches which we carried on our backs. We left before the others and 
got back to the city. Then we slipped through thin side streets, rushing to the 
crystal store near the west gate. Fifth bell rang right before we got to gate, which 
meant the more hasty stores were already packing up. Including the one next to 
the crystal store, which was scary, but in a stroke of luck our destination was still 
open. We slipped inside together. 

“Mister, we’re selling these.” The crystal store bought mana crystals, and so 
we put our pinky-sized mana crystals on the counter. The owner of the store 
pinched a crystal and held it up to examine it. 

“...Judging by the size, I’d say these are from shumils?” 

“Uh huh. We messed up when butchering them.” 

“Hahaha, that’s rough. Here, one middle copper each.” 

“Thanks, mister.” After selling the small mana crystals we couldn’t use 
ourselves for a middle copper each, Fey and I rushed out of the store. Fey flicked 
the middle copper in his hand and listened to the nice ring. 

“Lutz, c’mon, let’s hang at the east side.” 

“This is Ralph’s money, not mine. I’ve got nothin’.” 

“He won’t mind sharing a little, c’mon.” The east side of the city had a lot of 
merchants, inns, and places to eat. With bars opening and merchants calling over 
potential customers, the east side of the city was definitely going to get real busy 
real fast. 

We headed that way and Fey immediately used his middle copper to buy two 
ranshels, a tasty fruit that’s easy to eat. He then threw one my way while telling 
me not to drop it. I jumped in the air to catch it, definitely not wanting to drop 
the fruit Fey was going out of his way to give me. 

We started walking home, loudly chewing the ranshels down. Sixth bell rang 
soon after, which signaled the closing of the gates. Stores and workshops all over 
the place began closing down. In moments, the street we were walking down 
was flooded with people walking home just like us. 

We slid into a side alley to avoid the crowds and take a shortcut home. The 
sun began to sink and I could see the alley getting darker before my eyes. 

“...Y’know, Lutz, you spend a lotta time with Myne. Dont’cha think she’s 


scary?” said Fey in the darkness, his voice a little quieter than usual. I turned to 
look at him in surprise and saw that he wasn’t wearing his normal mischievous 
grin. He looked afraid. 

“When Myne glared at me with those rainbow eyes, it felt like, like, I 
couldn’t breathe. It hurt. Just thinking about that freaks me out. Myne’s just 
weird and scary.” 

I tilted my head a bit and tried thinking hard about Myne’s scariness. “She’s 
kinda scary, since it’s like her head’s built different from ours. If she came 
swinging at us with like, a club, we’d beat her easily. But Myne would never do 
that. She’s scary ’cause you don’t know what she’ll do to you. But that’s fine. 
You just have to not make her mad. And the only thing she gets mad about is 
book stuff, so yeah.” 

I heard Fey let out a relieved sigh. “Alright. Well, I’m just gonna try to avoid 
her. I dunno what’ll make her mad or not.” He shook his head. “I couldn’t ask 
anyone else this, ’cause they wouldn’t get it. Glad I know what to do now,” he 
murmured as he threw away the core of his fully eaten ranshel. 

...Weird and scary, huh? I dunno about that. I threw away my finished 
ranshel too and looked up at the darkening blue sky. As it came closer to 
resembling Myne’s hair, the moon rose, looking just like the color of her eyes. 


Unchanging Daily Life 


“Okay, Shuu. I’ll be here.” 

“Yeah. I’ll come getcha when it’s closing time. Don’t leave without me, 
alright?” 

“I don’t get to come to this library often, so believe me, I won’t waste time 
like that,” responded Urano, pushing up her glasses before spinning around and 
practically skipping into the library. 

Her hair was done up in braids on both sides. She didn’t do it herself, 
naturally. Her mom insisted that she should look nice on their trip and wouldn’t 
let her go until it was done. Don’t get why, really. Urano’s never gonna care 
about anything but books. 

Whether you did her hair or bought her new clothes, Urano would always do 
the same thing on her trips. She’d go to the nearest library, search for books she 
hadn’t read before, and then read them until I came to get her. It was that or I’d 
travel from bookstore to bookstore with her, working as both a guide and a pack 
mule. I’d been her friend long enough to know it’s one or the other. And I was 
actually interested in enjoying this trip, so I didn’t want to spend all day at 
bookstores. I was much happier throwing Urano into a library and having the 
day to myself. 

“This library closes at... 6:30PM on Saturdays, 5PM on weekends and 
holidays.” I set my alarm on my phone and walked away. 

Once outside the library, I looked around and saw a large park with a gigantic 
silver globe at the end. It was the roof of a planetarium that had continents drawn 
on it in the style of a globe. 

“...Been ten years now, huh?” Urano and I traveled here ten years ago as well. 
Or to be more accurate, Urano’s mom wouldn’t accept any gifts despite how 
much time I ended up spending at her house, which led to my mom organizing a 
trip under the pretense of it being something like an educational field trip. A gift 
in disguise. 

At this point I was more than old enough to stay at home alone, but I kept 
going along with the trips anyway out of respect for the both of them. “Urano’s 
mom just can’t get any rest when she’s around.” 


Anyway, time to figure out what to do ’ til the library closes, I thought while 
heading to the planetarium, which had reasonably aged over the past ten years. I 
passed by a stone marker with “City Park” carved onto it and watched kids 
playing beneath the warm sun and families feeding birds in the pond as I walked. 

“I gotta be more careful this time...” I clenched my first, remembering my 
mistake from ten years ago. 

♦ 

Ten years ago, I was an elementary schooler and I was absolutely pumped to 
be going on one of our bi-yearly field trips, both because it meant I got to spend 
time with my busy mom and because I got to go somewhere new. 

It was our fall field trip. Upon arriving at the station and checking into a hotel 
where we could unload our stuff, I stuffed napkins and candy and all sorts of 
things into a backpack, ready for adventure. But my mom was sleep deprived 
from paper work, and said, “Since it’s already past three, let me take a nap until 
suppertime,” before preparing for bed. Which meant I went straight to the 
neighboring room. 

“I’m here to play, Urano!” I went into the room, excited, and saw Urano’s 
mom slumped over in a chair, exhausted. Urano was sitting across from her and 
reading. 

“Shuu, Mom’s clocked out; she’s really tried. Let her sleep for a bit. We can 
play tomorrow.” That didn’t leave much room for arguing. I slumped over and 
went back to my room. 

“Mom, Urano’s mom is resting too...” 

“Mmm, okay. You can have this, Shuu.” Mom, yawning sleepily, took out a 
map from her bag. She spread it out and marked on it with a red pen. “The 
pedestrian deck here is really big and connects to all sorts of places. If you go 
out the exit by the receptionist’s desk on the second floor of the hotel, you’ll end 
up here. There ’re no cars in this area, so you can explore all you want. Your final 
destination is here, the planetarium. Use this map and try to see if you can make 
it there. If you make it, bring back an entry ticket as proof. Good luck, hun.” 

“Thanks, Mom. I’ll give it a shot!” With the map, compass, and cash in hand, 
I felt like I had become a hero. I was in unfamiliar territory and I would be going 
all the way to a planetarium on my own. 

“Shuu, tell Urano’s mom where you’re going!” 

“Got it! Sleep tight.” I once again headed to the neighboring room. When I 
told Urano’s mom that I was going on an adventure to reach the planetarium, she 
asked me to bring Urano with me. I didn’t really want to. She was slow and 


would get in the way... 

“I don’t mind, I guess, but Urano probably wants to keep reading here.” All 
my experience led to me being certain that Urano would choose to keep reading, 
but after looking at the map for a bit, she started preparing to leave. 

“Okay, let’s go, Shuu.” 

With the unusually adventurous Urano at my side, I followed Mom’s 
instructions and left through the automatic door by the second floor’s 
receptionist desk. It was my first time seeing it since we walked straight into the 
hotel from the train station, but the pedestrian deck really was massive. It 
branched off in a thousand directions, and my job was to find the right way to 

go- 

I grinned with the map spread out in front of me. But my first obstacle 
appeared immediately in the form of a fearsome foe. 

“Shuu, let’s go to that department store over there. It definitely has a 
bookstore inside,” said Urano, pointing toward a building on the other side of the 
deck from the hotel. But I wouldn’t have any fun going there. This... This 
freakin ’ Super Monster Bookworm! 

“No way! No! I’m going to the planetarium today.” 

“A new bookstore will definitely be way more fun than a planetarium!” 

“Not for me!” 

Urano mumbled unhappily under her breath and started reaching into her bag 
for a book, but I grabbed her hand to stop her and instead walked to the city 
park. The planetarium was at the back end of the park. I won’t let this Super 
Monster Bookworm get in my way! 

We walked along the pedestrian deck, and after crossing the big street, it 
sloped downwards and led to a path with big trees lined up on both sides. Once 
on the path, the sounds of cars on the street faded and were replaced with the 
cries of playing children and the rustling of leaves in the wind. 

“Shuu! It’s a library! There’s a library here!” 

“H-Hold on, Urano. We’re going to the planetari — ” I was about to stop her, 
like normal, but suddenly realized something. If I let her go into the library, she 
definitely wouldn’t leave on her own. And thinking about it, Urano was just 
getting in the way of my adventure. If I came to get her at closing time, she 
could read like she wanted to and I could explore like I wanted to. It was perfect. 

“Okay, Urano. Don’t leave until I get back.” 

“Okay. I’ll read books and wait for you.” Urano waved goodbye with a broad 
smile while dashing into the library. 


Having vanquished the Super Monster Bookworm, I spread out my map, 
heart racing with excitement to begin my adventure as originally planned. I 
turned my back to the library Urano entered and ran toward the big silver globe I 
could see further inside the park. 

“Aaah, that was fun.” 

The globe contained more than just a planetarium. There were tons of 
interactive science exhibits I could play with, so I just did that instead of seeing 
the show. I made friends with the kids there and competed to see who could 
move the most sand with magnets. We got stunned together over the weight of a 
meteor and fought to see who could generate the most electricity by pedaling. I 
kept playing until it was closing time at 5:30PM. 

When I left it was already pretty dark, since the sun fell early in autumn, and 
I felt the temperature drop immediately. It had been warm at noon, but not even a 
jacket was enough to stop me from feeling chilly. I jogged down the path lit by 
streetlights to the library with the shadows of swaying trees falling over me. 

“...Huh?” The library’s entrance was lit, but it was completely closed. The 
windows were covered with white curtains, and what I could see of the inside 
was pitch black. Nobody was there. I circled around the library, checking for lit 
up places where Urano might be reading and waiting for me. But I couldn’t find 
her. 

“She’s gotta have gone back to the hotel by now.” The hotel was close 
enough that it was just across the street. It just made more sense to go back to the 
hotel than to wait around for someone in an unfamiliar place. 

I ran toward the hotel. 

“Urano? No, she hasn’t come back.” The moment I went to her room and 
heard her mom say that, I felt the blood drain from my face. 

“Shuu, weren’t you supposed to be with her?” Mom glared at me, and I 
confessed that I had left Urano at the library to go to the planetarium alone. 

“’Cause I mean, I wanted to go to the planetarium, but the second we went 
outside Urano just kept talking about going to bookstores and going to the 
library. She was being selfish.” 

Urano’s mom looked up, as if she had realized something. I realized it too. 
“...A bookstore?!” Urano had been interested in going to a bookstore inside the 
department store. She always got active when it involved books. She definitely 
decided to go to the bookstore after the library closed. 

“I’m gonna go look for her!” 


“Hold on, Shuu. I’ll go with you.” Mom and I ran to the department store 
together, checked the map, and headed to the bookstore on the fifth floor. It was 
a big store, but it was just one of many. It didn’t take long for us to search every 
inch of the place. 

“She’s not here.” 

“...Maybe there’s another bookstore?” 

Mom asked a bookstore employee if there were any other bookstores nearby. 
She said, “I have a friend waiting at a bookstore, but I can’t figure out which 
one,” while spreading the map. The employee told her about two bookstores, 
both a short distance away from the pedestrian deck. 

“Let’s go, Shuu.” 

“...Mom, I don’t think Urano will be at either one of those.” 

“Why not?” 

“Urano only wanted to come here ’cause she thought for sure a huge 
department store would have a bookstore. She probably doesn’t know about 
those small bookstores, and I don’t think she’s proactive enough to ask around 
for directions to a bookstore and then walk all the way there in a place she’s 
never been before.” 

Urano would jump like an idiot into any bookstore she saw, but she wouldn’t 
walk around in the dark asking strangers for directions to nearby bookstores in a 
new place. 

“Oh? But didn’t you go on a bookstore pilgrimage as third graders on 
summer vacation? You surprised everyone by biking with Urano all the way to a 
bookstore miles and miles away, remember?” 

“We did that because she used a map and phone book to mark all the 
bookstores before we left. You didn’t tell us we were coming here until today, so 
it’s different. It’s more likely that she got kidnapped waiting for me at the 
library.” 

“I see... I suppose we should return to the hotel and call the police, then.” 

“Uh huh...” 

It was very likely that she had just been kidnapped while waiting in front of 
the library. She’d probably get tricked in a second by any kidnapper saying “Get 
in the van, I’ve got books.” 

This never would have happened if I checked when the library closed first...! 

“She wasn’t there, then? I’ll call the police,” Urano’s mom sighed, her brows 
furrowed. She first contacted the local city hall and told them a girl might be 


closed inside the library, but they replied that an employee had confirmed that 
nobody was still inside. 

“We should still go to the library and check, just to be sure. Urano has a 
history.” Urano had a habit of sitting in the oddest places to read, so back at 
home, she had once before been shut inside the library without realizing that it 
had closed. Ever since then, Urano ended up as a “person of interest” in the 
library and the employees there would always make absolutely certain that she 
didn’t stay inside past closing time. 

Urano’s mom called the police with shaking hands. She told them that Urano 
hadn’t returned, and asked if they could start their search in the library. 
“Although she would keep reading even if the library closed, she definitely 
would never leave the library on her own. If she’s not in the library, she has been 
kidnapped.” 

She informed them of Urano’s past history of being closed in libraries, and at 
the police’s request, the library opened for us immediately. I had called the 
insides of the library pitch-black, but in one corner the large lined-up windows 
drew in a lot of light from the outside, making the curtain seem kind of bright. 

“I do think that your daughter was most likely kidnapped. I checked the 
library before closing, and even if someone was left, an elementary schooler 
would know to use the desk phone to call for help, no? They could call for help 
through the window, open the curtains, try to attract the attention of passerbys...” 
A library employee, unfortunately forced into working past his normal hours, 
turned on the light switch. 

I ran through the now well-lit library, looking for the windows that had 
looked bright from the outside. As expected, Urano sat at the windowsill, 
reading books spread out across the short bookcase beneath it. 

“Urano!” 

Upon hearing my voice, she looked up from her book, shut it, and turned 
toward me. Despite how desperately we had been searching for her, to the point 
of calling the police, she looked completely calm and unbothered. 

“There you are, Shuu. You sure took a while. It’s pitch black outside.” 

“It’s pitch black inside the library, too! How could you not notice that, you 
idiot?!” I reflexively let out a scream. 

Urano glared at me, cheeks puffed into a pout. “Don’t be mean. I noticed that 
it was dark and hard to read.” 

“You’re an idiot for noticing that and not getting out of here! You Super 
Monster Bookwoooorm!” 


♦ 

This time, after seeing the show in the planetarium, I went shopping and 
made sure to get back to the library before closing time. Urano’s favorite spot 
was whichever chair was placed closest to a bookshelf. No matter what library it 
was, she always sat in the chair closest to a bookshelf, so it wasn’t ever that hard 
to find her. 

I looked around the library that I hadn’t really taken the time to examine ten 
years ago. The underside of the staircase had a plastic chain with a “no entry” 
sign on it, which was fitting because Urano had avoided the light from the 
setting sun ten years ago by moving to the underside of the staircase. Really, it 
was probably there because of her. 

As those thoughts crossed my mind, I soon found Urano. She was reading 
books, like always. Despite her newly bought clothes and her dressed-up hair, 
she was doing the same thing she always did. Her eyes ran across the page as she 
consumed word after word with a slight smile on her face. 

“Urano, it’s almost closing time.” 

“Oh, Shuu. Looks like you managed to get here before dark this time.” Urano 
shut her book and stood up, smiling. 

“...You remember that?” 

“Of course. Mom got mad at me and said she’d never buy me a new book 
again if I kept reading after dark. Ever since then, I kinda snap out of my trance 
whenever it gets dark while I’m reading.” Urano sighed, which reminded me that 
ever since then, she would also say “I’m still here!” if the library she was in 
started to close while she was in it, rather than just keep reading without really 
caring or noticing. 

“Looks like even the Super Monster Bookworm has grown up a little...” As I 
thought about how she had matured a bit over the past ten years, I saw her 
standing in front of a bookshelf and reading a new book instead of cleaning up 
like she was supposed to. 

“You haven’t grown at all!”
