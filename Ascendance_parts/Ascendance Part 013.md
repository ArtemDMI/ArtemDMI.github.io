...This feels pretty familiar. The way people on the sidelines waving and 
cheering as those on the road advanced forward made it feel just like a marathon. 
Distant cheers grew louder as the group of kids approached where we were. I 
looked to Tuuli, who was right beside me, and saw that she had kind of stiffened 
up with nervousness. I stretched as far as I could and poked Tuuli on the cheek. 

“Wha? Why?” 

“Smile. You’re cutest when you smile, Tuuli. Believe me.” 

Tuuli’s eyes opened wide, and then she smiled like she usually did. “Geez, 
Myne.” 

“That ain’t right, Myne. Tuuli’s the cutest even when she doesn’t smile.” 

Aaah, what am I gonna do with you, Dad? 

Soon enough, we saw the front of the crowd. In the midst of the loudest 
cheers, clapping, and whistling yet, I saw plenty of kids wearing similarly white 
clothing. Some had bright smiles, some looked uncomfortable, some looked 
smug, some looked nervous, but they all walked forward together. Tuuli and Fey 
stepped forward out of our group of onlookers. They walked forward briskly, 
watching the group of kids, and then joined in the back. After confirming that 
they had safely joined the group, we and Fey’s family joined the group of 
families further in the back. 

More and more kids joined bit by bit as we crossed intersections. I had no 
idea how huge our group would be when we reached the center of the city. Some 
parents were already teary eyed from emotion just from walking with the group. 
For example, Dad. 

I jogged a bit to keep up with the procession, walking among the loud cheers 
with everyone else. Since the cheers were coming from everywhere, I looked 
around and saw people watching on from the windows of their houses, and I 
even saw some people tossing small white flowers our way in celebration. The 
flowers drifted down as if they were coming from the blue sky itself. The 
children in the front let out happy cries. I was so short that I could really only see 
the hands of kids reaching up to try and catch some of the flowers. 

The group stopped after reaching the fountain where the main roads 
connected. The kids from the other roads joined together, swelling our numbers 
enormously all at once. This was as far as Dad and I could go. 

“Wrong way, Dad.” 

I took Dad’s hand, stopping him from walking with the group to the temple, 
and pulled him away from the group. We walked to the side of the road and 
joined the onlookers so as to not get in anyone’s way. 


“Tuuli...” 

“Geez! This way, Dad.” 

Once the group passed, the onlookers began heading home. We followed the 
others and headed to the southern gate with Dad turning around multiple times, 
regret in his eyes. 

We’re not going to be late, are we? 

“Captain! You’re late!” Otto immediately called out to us with a sharp look 
once we reached the gate, then sent Dad to the meeting room. 

I would be using my slate to learn words just like always. In a pleasant 
surprise, today he was going to start teaching me the names of commonly traded 
products so that I could read the material ledgers that merchants would show to 
identify what they were bringing with them. The names of these products were 
the first words that were actually relevant to my daily life. 

Today’s words all had to do with currently seasonable vegetables. It was easy 
to learn the words for vegetables often used in cooking like pome (a tomato that 
looks like a yellow paprika), vel (red lettuce), and fisha (green eggplant), but it 
was hard to mentally picture the vegetables I hadn’t eaten before, so they took 
longer to learn. I really wish I could go to the market to match the words with the 
real thing. Butchers are still too much for me, though. 

As I was practicing my letters alone, a relatively young soldier rushed in 
holding paperwork. 

“Do you know where Otto is?” 

“He’s in a meeting right now.” 

“Oooh, that’s right! Crap...” Apparently, today’s guard couldn’t read 
paperwork very well. 

“Do you want me to read it for you?” 

“Wha? You?” 

“I am Mr. Otto’s assistant, you know.” 

He looked at me very suspiciously. But I couldn’t blame him, since I 
definitely looked too young to be literate. I was used to looks like his. In any 
case, I had only offered to help out of kindness, so I didn’t mind if he didn’t 
want to show it to me. Which seemed to be the case, so I dropped my eyes back 
to my slate and returned to studying. 

“...You can read?” asked the guard, looking surprised after seeing me start 
writing on my slate. 

Whether or not I could read depended entirely on what kind of paperwork it 


was. I hadn’t memorized everything yet. “Ummm, I can read inquiries and letters 
of introduction without issue. I can read the numbers on material ledgers, but not 
the products listed.” 

“Okay, this is a letter of introduction. I’d really appreciate your help.” 

Noble letters were annoying to read due to how indirect they tended to be, 
but if you stripped off the purple prose, nothing that complex was written. 

Person X was introducing Person Y, and they needed Person Z’s seal. That was 
all you needed to discern from them. 

I inhaled deeply, filling my lungs with the scent of parchment and ink as I ran 
my eyes over the letter. Aaaah... The gate commander is in the meeting too. 

Since this is a letter from a laynoble, a lower-ranked noble, I think it should be 
fine to have the one being introduced wait until the meeting is over. 

“Ummm, it looks like this is an introduction from Baron Blon, and the person 
is headed to see Baron Glaz. The commander’s seal is necessary.” 

I returned the parchment while reminding myself how Otto usually did his 
job. Even I could do this job once I had the instruction manual memorized. 

“Please have the merchant who brought this wait in the room for laynobles. 
Tell him that the commander is in a meeting with an archnoble and he needs 
some time before he can give his seal. I think Baron Glaz’s visitor won’t be 
pushy about this.” 

“Thanks. That’s a big help.” 

He tapped his chest twice in salute, so I jumped off my chair and returned it. 
At some point, saluting had become second nature for me while working for 
Otto. Mmmm, at this rate, I think I might accidentally end up employed as a 
secretary here. I had intended to make paper and open a bookstore before my 
apprentice work next year began, but I had stumbled and there was no end in 
sight. 

I went back to work studying words on my slate, and soon Dad rushed in. 
“Time to go home, Myne.” 

“Um, a second ago, someone...” 

“You can tell me on the way back. Tuuli’s waiting.” Dad put my slate and pen 
into my tote bag and hoisted me up before walking out with his stuff. I started 
slapping my dad’s shoulder, caught off guard by the pace of his walking. 

“Dad?! Um, come on! I have a report...” 

“We’re outta here before Otto sees us.” 

“Wait! I really have a report for Mr. Otto!” 

While we were in the midst of arguing, Otto caught up to us. 


“Ah, Mr. Otto. A merchant with a letter of introduction from Baron Blon to 
Baron Glaz came. Since the commander was in a meeting, I had him be taken to 
the waiting room for laynobles. Please take care of this as soon as possible.” 

“That’s the kinda good work I expect from my assistant. Great job.” 

“She’s my daughter,” said Dad, making Otto sigh and rub his temples. 

“My skilled assistant, I give you an important job: Go home with this captain 
immediately. He was so antsy during the meeting that an archnoble glared at us 
and thereby shaved years off my life.” 

“...Dad, you need to treasure your life more.” 

“Otto’s telling us to go, so let’s not keep him waiting.” 

I let Dad carry me home, and that night we had a family celebration for 
Tuuli’s birth season. My internal view of celebrations involved cake, but we 
didn’t have anything like that in our home. The only thing I could make with our 
ingredients was an attempt at french toast. 

I had Mom cut the fairly hard multigrain bread into slices, which I then 
covered with milk and eggs that I got by exchanging recipes with Lutz’s family. 
It was finished once Mom cooked it with butter. Since we didn’t have sugar or 
honey, we had jam made from a raspberry-like fruit as a side. 

I also made one other thing for Tuuli: soup with specially chopped 
vegetables. Tuuli loved it, since she thought the heart and star shaped vegetables 
were cute. 

“Here, Tuuli. Your presents.” 

“Wooow! Thanks, Mom! Dad!” 

They gave Tuuli clothes and tools for work. After turning seven and being 
baptized, kids began work as apprentices. Some workplaces had places for their 
apprentices to live, but Tuuli would be walking to her apprentice seamstress job. 
I guess she’s aiming to be a beauty by getting good at sewing. I understand. She 
wants Ralph to say she’s a good woman. Uh huh. 

“You don’t have work every day, right?” 

“Well, I won’t be able to do any serious work for now, so I’ll go there for 
about half of each week.” 

“After all, the workers won’t be able to do their own job if they spend all the 
time time training apprentices.” 

Makes sense. My own studies were put on hold when the apprentice guards 
are being trained, and Otto did have more work because of them. 

“And Myne, this is for you.” My parents took a long bundle of cloth and 
placed it on the table. Blinking, I tilted my head in confusion, not understanding 


why I was being given a gift on Tuuli’s baptism. 

“But I didn’t get baptized today.” 

“Now that Tuuli has work, it’s your job to pick up firewood, Myne. You’ll 
need this.” 

I opened the bundle of cloth and saw a gleaming knife. The blade was thick 
and it was heavy enough to weigh my hands down. If this were Japan, my 
parents would be chastised for giving such a dangerously sharp thing to a child, 
but in this world, you couldn’t even protect yourself without a knife. Those who 
can’t help or do anything are treated like babies. 

...I have my own knife now. Up until now, I’ve been treated like a baby. 
Helping Tuuli do the real helping at best, and just getting in the way at worst, 
which is most of the time. But since Tuuli was starting work as an apprentice, 
they had no choice but to give me my own knife. 

...A knife! Now I can make mokkan! Wooden mokkan! 


I Love You, Yellow River Culture 


The day Tuuli went to work as an apprentice for the first time, I was stunned. 

I could barely do any of the chores entrusted to me. I had the knowledge of my 
past life in a modern world, which I thought would have made things easier, but 
it absolutely didn’t. 

...Tuuli was truly a mighty older sister. 

First of all, I couldn’t carry water. I couldn’t even get it out of the well 
properly; I was too weak. The best I could do was get a little water into the 
bucket and struggle back up the stairs. It took me five trips just to get one normal 
bucket’s worth. Of course, one bucket of water wasn’t enough. We needed our 
whole home water jug to be filled. Mom would help, but she was so much faster 
she would fill the whole jug by the time I had brought a bucket’s worth. I... I was 
useless. 

Mom told me to light a fire in the hearth so she could prepare lunch. I had 
spent some time camping in the past, so I knew how to organize firewood. I put 
thick wood next to thin, easier to burn wood while leaving passages for air. I 
even put dried grass on top since it was easier to ignite. That was all easy. But I 
couldn’t start the actual fire. When camping, I had used a lighter. I had no 
experience using flint stones. I tried remembering what Tuuli had done and 
mimicking her. 

“Hyaaah? ! ” I slammed the two rocks together, and naturally, sparks flew. But 
the sparks surprised me to the point I reflexively dropped the stones. After that I 
became unable to slam the stones together at all, fearing that the sparks would 
burn me. Someone else ultimately had to do it for me. I... I was useless. 

I could help with cooking, at least. Or so I thought, but no. The knives were 
too heavy and I needed both hands just to lift them. And I froze up looking at the 
chicken being held down. The best I could do was take food Mom had chopped 
up and slice it into smaller pieces, plus tell her recipes. I couldn’t do much 
myself. I was so short I couldn’t stir a pot even when standing on something. 
Mom complimented my recipes, but my own weakness was seriously 
depressing. I... I really was useless. 

“What’s wrong, Myne?” said Tuuli after coming home from her first day on 


the job and seeing me thoroughly depressed. 

Mom, forcing a smile, answered for me. “...She’s sad that she couldn’t do any 
of the chores I gave her today.” 

“Wha? Didn’t we all expect that?” 

Indeed... Everyone had expected it. Including myself, but still. I was shocked 
by how useless I really was. 

“I tried doing lots of things, but they were all too much for me.” 

“Well, now that you know your problems, why don’t you get to work fixing 
them?” 

“Myne, you may be feeling sad right now, but just know you’re better at 
cleaning than any of us.” 

When it came to sweeping with a broom and wiping things down, neither 
took much strength and I had plenty of experience with both. Though I would 
get a fever if I got too enthusiastic about it. 

Plus, I didn’t consider cleaning as part of my chores. I just couldn’t stand to 
live in a filthy environment. I was already sickly enough, I didn’t need a dirty 
home making my health worse. My actions were motivated by self-interest and 
nothing more. 

I knew how to clean, wash dishes, and cook thanks to my Urano days, but 
none of that knowledge was useful here. To be honest, I had no idea doing 
chores would be this difficult. Tuuli could do it and she was only a year older 
than me. Why was I so weak? Why was I so useless? 

...I wish I had been reborn into a healthier body. Healthy enough to at least 
not be dead weight. 

“Heh, Myne. Are you really that worried about being useless?” asked Dad. 

“...Obviously.” 

“Yeah, figures... But I’m not expecting that much from you anyway, Myne.” 

Um? Is it just me, or did he say something really mean with a smile on his 
face? I knew I wasn’t the most helpful person around, but I didn’t expect a father 
this obsessed with doting over his daughters to just up and say “I’m not 
expecting that much from you anyway” right in front of me. 

As I stood there stunned, Dad patted my head and spoke with tears forming 
in the corners of his eyes. “For years I’ve been worried that the next time you 
got sick would be the last day of your life. But you’re healthier now, and that’s 
good enough for me,” said Dad, which made Tuuli shrug. 

“I think Dad’s right, but who would hire Myne at this rate? I mean, Myne 
can’t do anything on her own.” 


Dad shook his head. “Nah. We could hire her at the gate.” 

“Huh? What job could Myne do there?” 

Mom and Tuuli looked confused, but really, I had no idea why. Dad and I had 
talked to them about what I was doing at the gate before. 

“What’re you two confused about? Paperwork. She’s been helping Otto each 
time we go to the gate. Though most of the time he’s teaching her to read and 
write.” 

“Whaaa?! She hasn’t just been resting at the gate?” 

“Myne wasn’t exaggerating about all those things?!” 

Tuuli, why are you that surprised? And ouch, Mom, that hurts. I can’t believe 
you thought I wasn ’t telling the truth. 

“Myne’s especially good at math, I hear. If she doesn’t find a job she wants 
by her baptism, she can work at the gate. And you want to work with your daddy 
anyway, right Myne?” 

“What? No way. I want to be a (librarian), or own a (bookstore).” 

Unfortunately, my list of dream jobs did not include doing paperwork at the 
gate with my dad. Though naturally, since I had never seen a bookstore or 
librarian in this world, none of them understood what I had just said. 

“...Aaah, Myne. What are you talking about?” 

“Someone who sells books, so... a merchant? Mmm, I don’t think I have the 
personality for being a merchant, but I want a job that deals with books.” 

“Eh, well, I dunno what you mean, but I hope you can do what you want. For 
now, just do what you can. Half a year ago you couldn’t walk to the forest. You 
didn’t even want to go outside. But now you can walk to the forest and back on 
your own.” 

“...Uh huh.” 

With all that said, they told me to do my best with gathering firewood, so 
both Tuuli and I left home with baskets on our backs. Although it was true that I 
could walk to the forest, I had to take a break once we were there before I could 
move again, and if I wasn’t careful, I’d be bedridden the next day. I really hated 
how weak my body was. 

After reaching the forest and catching my breath, I started picking up 
firewood. I was just looking around and picking up whatever looked good, but 
Tuuli used a billhook-esque blade to chop sticks off a tree. 

“You’re amazing, Tuuli.” I was once again reminded of Tuuli’s dexterity. “I 
need to start at the bottom and do what I can for now, I guess.” It didn’t take 


long for me to run out of breath picking up branches. I sat on a rock to rest and 
took out my knife to get right to work on a mokkan. 

“Ngh, I didn’t expect it to be so heavy.” I sighed with the dully gleaming 
knife in hand. It wasn’t as if I had never used a blade in my life. I used kitchen 
knives and box cutters all the time in Japan. But I didn’t have any experience 
carving wood. 

At some point in elementary school, a lesson involved me using a small knife 
to manually sharpen a pencil. It was only now that I felt sincere, painful regret 
over how I had barely participated, thinking that in the age of pencil sharpeners I 
didn’t need to waste my time learning to sharpen them myself. 

...I mean, I can barely even hold the knife right, much less carve mokkan with 
it! No way could I use the knife well when I was too incompetent to even 
sharpen a pencil. Would it even be possible for me to make mokkan? 

To experiment, I tried carving off a little bit off the thinnest branch I had 
collected. It was a struggle with my tiny weak hands, but I managed to get some 
of the outer layer off, which revealed its insides. Oh... This is kinda hard, but I 
think I can do it! I could practice my knife skills while making mokkan. Two 
birds with one stone. I excitedly took the branch and carved it flat with the knife. 
There were plenty of thin branches about as long as this one. If I just carved 
them all flat and tied them together with string, I would have some fine mokkan. 
It might even be usable in place of a memo pad. 

...Yellow River Culture and my ancestors, you have my sincere thanks for this 
splendid wisdom. I love you all. Father, Mother, thank you for this wonderful 
knife. I can make mokkan thanks to it. 

Since this just involved picking up branches and carving them, there was 
much less work involved than the clay-digging for tablets and the fiber fiddling 
with faux-papyrus. This... This is good. 

I carved down the wood in my hands bit by bit, making it as flat as possible 
for the purpose of writing. It would have been nice to be strong enough to slice it 
in half in one go, but there was no use wishing for something I didn’t have. I just 
had to take my time and put in the work to make as many mokkan as I wanted. It 
was hard enough for me to cut branches that I would only be able to write a 
single line of text on each mokkan, which meant I would want a lot of them. 

“Myne, is that what you’re making to replace the clay tablets?” asked Lutz as 
he peered over my shoulder, seemingly finished gathering his firewood. His 
unexpected question threw me off. 

“...Wha? How’d you know these were replacements for the clay tablets?” 


“Cause Myne, you look like you’re having tons of fun.” 

“Wha? Fun?” ” 

“You look like you’re about to rub your cheeks on that wood. I remember 
you looking at clay tablets the same way.” 

Wait... What? I was carving wood all by myself while looking one step away 
from rubbing my cheeks against it? Wouldn’t that mean it looked like I was in 
love...? Bwuuuh! Subconscious stuff is the worse! I’m so embarrassed! While I 
panicked on the inside, overwhelmed by embarrassment, Lutz took a hard look 
at the mokkan I was making. 

“So, what’re you making?” 

“...I’m making (mokkan).” 

“Mo-what? Is that somethin’ else you can write on?” 

“Uh huh. So I want a lot of them. It’s too hard for me to make big ones on my 
own.” I readied my knife again and began carving the branches. Lutz sat next to 
me and grabbed a somewhat thick branch. 

“I’ll help. If you wanna thank me, could you let me meet that Otto guy you 
talked about before?” 

“Why?” 

“I wanted to hear about traveling merchants, so...” said Lutz in a quiet voice, 
as if worried about people around us hearing. He had acted like that before, 
when he told me that his dream was to leave the city as a traveling merchant or a 
bard so that he could explore the world. I could guess, then, that traveling 
merchants and bards were frowned upon in this world. Weird. But regardless of 
what I thought, the best thing for Lutz would be for him to meet Otto and hear 
what he had to say. 


“He seems like a busy person, but I’ll try. Sorry if he turns me down.” 

“Hey, that’s all I can ask for.” Lutz let out a sigh of relief, as if a heavy 
burden had been lifted off his shoulders. I could tell that he had never been able 
to talk to anyone about this before now. 

The two of us steadily kept carving, without talking too much. Lutz 
unsurprisingly had a billhook-esque knife just like Tuuli which allowed him to 
make several large mokkan out of the thick branch. I used my knife to smooth 
their surfaces further. I now had wooden boards to use as mokkan, but both of 
their sides were pure white. 

...I wonder if they’ll let me borrow ink from the gate? Ink was generally used 
with paper, so it wasn’t sold in stores for commoners either. And speaking of 
which, both ink and parchment were stored securely together. It could be that ink 
was just as expensive as paper. 

Well, I’ll try and see if I can negotiate with Otto to be paid in ink from now on 
instead of slate pens. I can mention Lutz’s request while I’m at it. 


I Want Ink 


There was nobody to watch over me when Tuuli went to work, so I went to 
the gate to study. I was having lots of fun now that I was learning words more 
relevant to my life.
