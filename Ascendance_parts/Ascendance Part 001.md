...I need to clean up this room and figure out how to take baths ASAP. I’m the 
kind of lazy person that avoided chores as much as possible even with 
convenient modern electronics. I cared more about reading books than helping 
my mom. Am I gonna be able to live here? 

I shook my head to get those thoughts out of my mind. No, no. Like I said, it’s 
a miracle I got reincarnated at all. I need to be more positive. How lucky! I get 
to read books that don’t even exist on Earth! ...Okay. I’m getting enthusiastic 
again. 

First, in order to focus on reading books without worrying, I had to take care 
of my body. I slowly shut my eyes so I could rest. As my consciousness faded 
into darkness, one thought dominated my mind: 

I don’t care what it is. I just want to read a book as soon as possible. Aaah, 
whichever god put me here, please pity me and grant me a book! Also, this might 
be asking for a bit much, but I want a library filled to the brim with books too. 


Exploring My Home 


Three days had passed since I became Myne. Those were three very intense 
days. I had survived several brutal battles I couldn’t talk about without crying. 

First of all, I snuck out of bed to try and look around the house for books, but 
Mom found me and forced me back into bed. She got super mad. I tried several 
times to escape but failed every time. Every single time. It got so bad that she’d 
put me back in bed every time she saw me unless I was using the bathroom! 

In the end, I didn’t get any chances to look for books. Not only that, but even 
though using the toilet was the only freedom offered to me, it too ended up as a 
terrible struggle. The “bathroom” in this place was a chamber pot in the corner 
of the bedroom. 

To make matters worse, Myne apparently couldn’t use the toilet on her own 
before now, so I had to relieve myself while a family member watched. No 
matter how much I screamed “I can do it on my own! Don’t watch!”, nobody 
budged. They got mad at me, asking what I’d do if I got pee everywhere. 

I ended up using the pot while crying, and believe it or not, Tuuli 
complimented me. “Wow, Myne! You’ve gotten really good at this. Soon you’ll 
be able to do it on your own,” she said. I could appreciate that she was happy for 
her little sister growing up, but my pride, dignity, and self-respect as a human 
being were in tatters. 

By the way, not only did my family use the bathroom in a chamber pot, they 
even dumped it right out the window. Unbelievable. 

Changing clothes was a fearsome struggle as well. I tried doing it on my own, 
but my dad, who I barely knew all things considered, took charge and changed 
my clothes for me. That was so embarrassing I actually started to cry, insisting I 
could do it on my own, but he just interpreted that as me throwing a tantrum. 
Absolutely unbelievable. 

Since my original dad had died when I was young, I didn’t really understand 
how to interact with a father. Although Myne’s memory told me I loved him, I 
could only see him as a mean-looking muscular guy. He was super strong thanks 
to working as a soldier, and all my resistance was crushed before his might. 

Three days of constantly losing to my family resulted in my young maidenly 


heart and sense of shame getting torn to shreds. 

I’m a young girl. My family has to take care of me. This is just how things 
have to be. ...If I don’t think like that, I’ll just die! I can’t take this any longer! 
This life is too much! Or so I screamed in my head, but there really was no 
helping my situation. Even if I ran away from home, a weak and sickly girl like 
me wouldn’t be able to do anything on her own. I’d just end up running through 
the streets in search of a shower, screaming in horror amid the waste raining 
from above, until I eventually died miserably of hunger. 

Although it may have sounded like I’d experienced nothing but failure here, 
that wasn’t the case. I had my own small victories. For example, after being 
unable to bear my own filth, I asked Tuuli to wipe my body over with a warm 
cloth each day and she accepted. I mean, if I'm going to get stripped anyway, 
why would I not have her wipe me clean? I'm past the point of shame here. 

I wonder if the people of this world have something against wiping each 
other’s bodies. Tuuli looked at me really weirdly each time she did it, but I felt 
great. The hot water in the bucket ended up filthy the first day, but lately it 
always ended up a lot more clear. That said, my head was still itchy. I knew we 
didn’t have any, but I wanted shampoo. 

There was something else I managed to get, too: a hair stick to keep my hair 
together! I asked for a wooden stick to keep my long, straight hair from getting 
everywhere, and Tuuli actually carved one out of a piece of wood for me. 

Well, the first thing I did was find Tuuli’s doll and ask if I could snap it’s leg 
off, which made her cry. I do feel bad about that. But to be fair, even though it 
was precious to her with pieces carved out of wood by Dad and clothes sewn by 
Mom, it just kinda looked like a cheap toy to me. I didn’t know it was so 
important at a glance. 

Anyway. I rolled my hair into a bun, but Tuuli told me that only adults wore 
all of their hair up like that, so I settled on a half-up hairstyle. This world’s 
culture sure is different. 

I was stuck humiliating myself every day, so the only thing left for me to do 
was get on my two feet and improve things however I could. To that end, I 
needed books. 

The first step to improving my life here would be getting books. With books, 

I wouldn’t mind spending my whole life in bed, and I could deal with the harsher 
aspects of life. I could, and I would. 

So, I decided to explore my home today through any means necessary. I 
hadn’t read any books in a long time and withdrawal symptoms were beginning 


to show. It wouldn't be long before I started screaming “Books, give me boooks! 
Waaah!” while sobbing and flailing. 

“Myne, are you asleep?” Tuuli opened the door and popped her head in. After 
seeing that I was still quietly lying in bed, she nodded to herself in satisfaction. 

Over the past three days, I had constantly snuck out of bed after waking up 
and tried looking for books, so both Mom and Tuuli — who had been taking 
care of me most of the time — were completely on guard. Tuuli in particular was 
desperate to keep me in bed while Mom was at work throughout the day, since 
she had been entrusted with babysitting me. My small body was incapable of 
beating Tuuli, no matter how hard I tried to run away. 

“One day, I’m gonna (ascend) out of here.” 

“What was that, Myne?” 

“...Mmm? I just said that I can’t wait to grow up.” 

Tuuli, naturally not noticing the true intent behind my sugar-coated words, 
gave a troubled smile. “You’ll get a lot bigger once your sickness goes away. 
You’re sick all the time, so you barely eat. Sometimes people think you’re three 
years old even though you’re already five.” 

“What about you, Tuuli?” 

“I’m six years old, but a lot of people think I’m seven or eight, so I think I’ll 
be okay.” 

We were born a year apart and there’s this much of a difference between us? 
Looks like my ascension might end up being a little harder than I thought. But I 
won’t give up. I’ll clean this place up, eat carefully, and get healthy in no time. 

“Mom went to work, so I’m going to go wash the dishes. Don’t get out of 
bed, okay? No matter what. You won’t get better if you don’t sleep, and if you 
don’t get better, you won’t grow.” 

I had been acting nice for the past day in order to loosen up Tuuli’s guard, 
quietly waiting in bed for the moment she left. 

“Okay, I’m going. Be good while I’m gone.” 

“Okaaaay.” I gave Tuuli the answer she wanted and she shut the bedroom 
door. 

Heh... Heh heh heh...l Now, hurry up and leave. 

I quietly waited for Tuuli to gather the dishes into a basket and take them 
outside. I didn’t know where she washed them, but I knew she generally went 
outside for thirty minutes when doing so. Our home didn’t have water, so I could 
extrapolate that there was a shared source of water outside somewhere. I heard 
the clink of the lock and then listened as Tuuli’s footsteps disappeared down the 


steps. 

Okaaay... It’s hunting time. Tuuli’s definitely old enough to have a few picture 
books around the place. I’ll find some books in no time once I start looking. 
Definitely. No way there’s a house without books in it. I probably won’t be able 
to actually read the book, but I’ll be able to imagine what’s going on from the 
pictures and guess what the words mean. 

Once Tuuli’s footsteps had completely vanished, I stealthily slipped out of 
bed. I winced a little after my feet touched the floor; it was covered in dirt and 
felt grimy. My family had made it filthy walking around with their dirty shoes, 
and although I dreaded walking on it with my bare feet, Tuuli had taken away 
my clog-like wooden shoes to prevent me from going anywhere. I had no choice. 

Well... Finding books is more important than keeping my feet clean, anyway. 

The bed which I had been locked in for days due to my unrelenting fever had 
a basket beside it filled with children’s toys made from wood and straw, but no 
books. “It would be a lot easier for me if they were just in here...” 

I could feel dirt rubbing against the bottom of my feet each time I walked. It 
was normal in this family to keep shoes on in the house, so I knew nothing 
would come from me complaining. I knew it, but I couldn’t help myself. 

“Would someone bring me a broom and rag, pleeease?” Naturally, no one 
responded to my call, and neither a broom nor rag magically appeared from 
nowhere. 

“Ngggh! Am I already in trouble?” To me, the biggest hurdle to exploring the 
house was the bedroom door. I could kind of reach the doorknob if I stretched 
really, really hard, but actually turning it was a lot harder than I expected. 

I looked around the room for something I could step on, and noticed the large 
box that contained my clothing. “Nmmn...!” I would have had no problem 
moving it back in my Urano days, but my hands were so small now that I 
couldn’t make it budge no matter how hard I pushed. I thought about turning the 
toy-filled basket upside down and standing on it since I was so small anyway, 
but I was still probably heavy enough that it’d end up crushed. 

“I need to grow up fast. There’s so many things I can’t do with this body.” 

I looked around the room and, after thinking about what I could move, settled 
on balling up my parents’ comforter to use as a stepping stool. I would hate 
putting my own comforter on this dirty floor, but as my parents were used to 
living in this filth, I was sure they wouldn’t mind me using theirs. Definitely. 
Um... I’m sorry, Mom. Dad. There’s nothing I won’t do if books are on the line, 
even if it means I’ll get yelled at later. 


“Oof.” I got on the balled-up comforter and somehow managed to turn the 
doorknob using all of my body weight. 


The door opened with a creak, toward me. 

“Bwuh? ! ” 

I had been pulling down on the handle with my body weight, and the door 
shot toward me. I hurriedly let go before it hit me in the head, but it was too late. 
I fell backwards and rolled down the balled-up comforter before hitting the floor 
with a loud thump. 

“Oooow...” I stood up, holding my head, and saw that at least the door had 
stayed open. This head pain is a means to a noble end. 

I slipped into the open crack and shoved the door all the way open, sliding 
my parents’ comforter across the floor. It looked like that part of the floor had 
suddenly gotten cleaner, but I pretended I hadn’t seen anything. I hadn’t intended 
to make the comforter that much dirtier. 

I’m... I’m really sorry. 

“Oh, it’s the kitchen.” I left the bedroom and saw that there was a kitchen 
right outside it. Well, it wasn’t exactly fancy enough to be called a kitchen. It 
was like a place you could choose to cook, but wouldn’t really want to. 

There was a smallish table in the center of the room with two three-legged 
chairs and a long box that likely also served as a seat. On the right was a cabinet 
with a handle, probably with dishes stored inside. The wall closest to the 
bedroom had nails in it with metal pots, ladles, and pans hanging off of them. 
There was a furnace near them that probably worked as a stove. A string 
connected two walls and had dirty rags hanging off of it — they looked so dirty 
they’d probably make whatever they touched even more unclean. 

“Yuuuck. I think I know why I’m sick all the time.” 

The corner opposite from the furnace had a large water jug and a sink-like 
water basin. As expected, there was no running water. To top things off, there 
was a large basket filled with potatoes, onions, and other food products. There 
were a lot of things I didn’t recognize, so it was possible that the potatoes 
weren’t actually potatoes at all. 

“Hm? This one is... kind of like an avocado. I wonder if I can get oil from 
it?” I looked through the food and found one fruit in particular that interested 
me. If I could extract oil from it, I might be able to do something about my itchy 
head. 

My mom from back in my Urano days had a habit of getting obsessed with 
one random thing after another. She could only be described as whimsical to a 
fault. She made whatever was in front of her at the time the focal point of her 


life: TV shows about saving money, magazine articles about living in nature, 
foreign activities in a cultural center, anything. She always dragged me along 
with her, saying she “wanted me to get interested in something other than 
books,” but I knew she only ever got involved with things that interested her. 
Having no other choice, I tagged along every time, and thanks to that I might’ve 
learned just enough to make shampoo on my own. 

...Thank you, Mom. I think I might just survive over here. Encouraged by my 
findings, I looked around the room and saw that there were two doors other than 
the bedroom door. 

“Eheh. Left or right door, which one’s the prize?” The kitchen didn’t look 
like it had a bookshelf anywhere. I saw that one of the two doors was cracked 
open, so I pulled it all the way. 

“Mmm, a storage room? Guess this isn’t it.” It was a room packed with stuff I 
didn’t really understand the purpose of. There were shelves with stuff on them, 
but it was a real mess and it didn’t seem like the kind of place that would have a 
bookshelf. 

I gave up on it and tried opening the other door. It made a clicking sound 
when I pulled on it, signaling that it was locked. Minutes of trying to open it 
yielded no results. The door would not open. 

“...Wait. Is this the door Tuuli left from? Wha? Is that all?” If this door led 
outside, then our home had no bathtub, no toilet, no running water, and no 
bookshelves. It had nothing. No matter how hard I looked, I couldn’t find any 
other rooms. 

...Um, God, do you hate me? Is this a cruel joke? I asked to be reborn so that 
I could keep reading books even after I died. I didn ’t intend to be transported to 
another world with my Japanese memories and customs, forced to live in a home 
with no bathtub, no toilet, and no water. I thought for sure you’d take me to a 
world filled with books. 

“...Maybe books are expensive here?” According to my knowledge of history, 
books were extremely expensive until the invention of the printing press led to 
their mass production. Those not born into a rich or noble life would generally 
never read a single book in their lives. In which case, this wouldn’t be the kind 
of world where you give your neighbor’s kid a picture book as a birthday gift. 

“Ngh, fine. I’ll start looking for letters first instead.” I didn’t absolutely need 
books in order to study this world’s writing system. Posters, newspapers, 
manuals, calendars, and all sorts of things naturally had letters written on them. 
Or they did in Japan, at least. 


“...Nothing. There’s no letters anywhere! Not a single one!” 

I had walked around the rooms searching every shelf and cabinet I could find, 
but not only had I not found any books, I didn’t even find anything with a single 
letter on it. I couldn’t find letters or paper. 

“What’s going on here?” My head started to hurt, as if a fever had burst up 
within me out of nowhere. My heart throbbed and I could feel it screaming out, 
valves tightening. I dropped to the ground like a doll with its strings cut. My 
eyes burned on the inside. 

Well, okay, I got crushed by books. No helping that. That was basically my 
dream of dying buried by books. Fine. And it was true that I myself had asked to 
be reincarnated. I understand all that. 

...But you know, there aren’t any books here. There aren’t even letters. Not 
even paper! Can I really live in a place like this? Do I have any reason to live? 

A tear dripped down my cheek. I had never even once thought about a world 
without books. Such a thing was unfathomable to me. And yet here I was. 

Unable to think of a single reason to live on in this world as Myne, I felt my 
insides go hollow. I couldn’t stop crying. 

“Myne! Why aren’t you in bed?! Don’t walk around without your shoes on!” 
Tuuli had gotten home at some point and, seeing me on the kitchen floor, 
shouted with her blue eyes open wide in anger. 

“...Tuuli, there aren’t any (books)?” 

“What’s wrong? Are you feeling okay?” 

“Tuuli, I want (books). I want to read (books). I want to read them so much, 
but there aren’t any (books).” 

Tuuli called out to me, worried, as tears dripped down my cheeks. But she 
was completely used to a world without books. She wouldn’t understand my 
pain no matter what I said to her. 

...Is there anyone out there who can understand me? Anyone who knows 
where I can go to get books? Someone, tell me. Please. 


Exploring the City 


Yesterday, I cried and cried and cried. My parents got mad at me for dropping 
their comforter on the ground, and dinnertime came, but I just kept crying 
without reacting that much. When morning came, I had cried so much that my 
eyes were dry and puffy. My head pounded with pain. 

But my fever had gone down, and I didn’t feel nearly as sluggish. Plus, I felt 
a lot better in general since I had cried my heart out. Though my family basically 
had no idea how to treat me at breakfast. 

“Mmm, looks like your fever has gone down.” Mom touched my forehead 
with a hand that was cold from having just washed dishes. She also lightly 
pressed it against my swollen eyes. The cold felt so good. “If you’re feeling 
better, Myne, would you like to go to the market with me? One’s being held 
today.” 

Wait... Didn’t she say something about this being the busiest time of the year 
at her dyeing job, and that she had to go to work even while I was sick with a 
fever? 

Mom, seeing my confusion, lowered her eyes sadly. “It’s been so long since 
Tuuli’s had a chance to go outside instead of taking care of you, and she was so 
worried yesterday when you wouldn’t stop crying. The only thing we could think 
of was that you got lonely on your own, so I made the effort to convince my 
coworkers to cover for me today.” 

Upon hearing that, I gasped. I can’t believe I actually cried all day with 
people watching! I want to dig a hole and jump inside of it. Not much was worse 
than calming down and realizing how hard you embarrassed yourself the day 
before. 

“U-Um, I’m sorry.” 

“You don’t need to apologize, Myne. We all feel weak-hearted when we’re 
sick.” Mom rubbed my head gently, consoling me, but the kinder she was the 
more guilty I felt. 

I’m really, really sorry. I cried exclusively out of despair over the lack of 
books. I didn’t feel lonely without you at all. Tuuli was that worried about me, 
but I just cared about her leaving so I could look for books. I’m so sorry. 


“Tuuli’s going to the forest with everyone else, but you’re still too weak for 
that. Want to go shopping with Mommy?” 

“Uh huh!” 

“Oh my, I wonder where that enthusiasm came from.” Mom smiled happily, 
thinking that I was excited to be spending time with her, and I responded with a 
bright smile of my own. “Ahaha, I knew you would be excited for this.” 

Mom looked so happy that I didn’t go out of my way to correct her — my 
enthusiasm had just shot through the roof since I was excited about potentially 
finding a book outside. 

I would go shopping with her and have her buy me a book. I didn’t need a 
thick book in particular. Anything that I could use to learn this world’s writing 
system would be enough. Honestly, I’d be fine with a workbook aimed at 
children. If a book was too much, I’d settle for a chart of this world’s alphabet or 
whatever. 

I’m sure if I say, “I won’t be lonely if I have a book! I’ll stay home alone all 
day every day!” in a really cute voice, she’ll buy a picture book or two for her 
sick little daughter. Eheheh. I can ’t wait. 

“Okay, Mom. I’ll be back later!” Tuuli peered into the bedroom with a full 
smile. Since Mom was staying home, she didn’t have to babysit me all day. 

“Stay with the other kids, okay? Be careful.” 

“Okaaay.” Tuuli strapped a large basket onto her back and skipped out of the 
house. It seemed like she was going out to play and have fun, but she was 
actually helping out the family in a cmcial way: collecting firewood. She would 
also grab nuts, mushrooms, and other stuff while she was at it. Whether or not 
we had good, cheap meals each day depended largely on Tuuli. 

Um... Do your best, Tuuli! My lunch is counting on you! 

This poverty-stricken world didn’t have any schools, so children largely 
helped around the house or had jobs. Or at the least, schools never came up in 
Myne’s memories. Once kids got a little older than Tuuli, they began working as 
apprentices. If given the choice, I would’ve preferred to work as an apprentice 
librarian, or apprentice book saleswoman. Going to the market would provide 
the perfect opportunity to gather information on this kind of thing. I’d find the 
nearest bookstore, befriend the owner, and become an apprentice there. 

“Okay, Myne. Let’s go shopping.” 

It was the first time I was leaving home since becoming Myne and my first 
time wearing anything other than pajamas. My outfit was made up of worn out 
hand-me-downs from Tuuli and I had to put on several layers of the thick 


clothing. I was so bundled up it was kinda hard to walk, but nonetheless I took 
Mom’s hand and took my first step outside our home. 

...So cold! So narrow! So stinky! Perhaps due to this being a stone building, it 
felt like cold air was flowing from the walls themselves and not even my several 
layers of clothing could stop me from feeling a chill. I really would have liked to 
have a fleece jacket or some hand warmers. Not to mention a mask to block the 
smell and help stave off a cold. 

“Myne, be careful not to fall.” Right outside our home was a staircase leading 
down the building. My body was the size of a three-year-old toddler’s and each 
step was so large they filled me with terror. As Mom pulled me forward, I 
practically jumped down each wooden step one by one, listening to them creak 
as we spiraled down to the bottom of the building. For some reason, only the 
steps from the second floor downward were made out of pretty stone. 

We all live in the same building, why do they get special treatment? I pursed 
my lips, pouting, as we finally reached the bottom and went outside. If my 
counting was accurate, we were in the apartment on the fifth floor out of seven. 
To be honest, for someone as weak, small, and sickly as me, just getting out of 
the house was enough to be exhausting. Now I knew why almost all of my 
memories took place inside. Even now, I was out of breath by the time I got 
outside. It seemed likely that I would just pass out before we reached our 
destination. 

“Haaah, haaah... Mom, it’s hard to breathe. Wait a second.” 

“But all we’ve done is leave the house. Are you okay?” 

“I just... need a little, break...” 

As I steadied my breath and reminded myself I needed to shape up if I 
wanted to reach a bookstore, I looked around to get a grasp of my surroundings. 
A short distance away from our housing complex was a small plaza with a well 
in the middle. Only the ground around the well was paved with stone, and I 
could see several older women talking while washing their clothes. That was 
definitely the well Tuuli used to wash dishes and get our daily water. 

“I’ll carry you on my back, Myne.” Mom, who must have thought our 
shopping would never get done if she waited for me, somewhat forcefully 
plopped me onto her back and started walking away. I couldn’t remember this 
myself, but judging by how she had something like a baby carrier on her back, 
she was probably used to carrying Myne around. 

The plaza with the well was surrounded by tall apartment-like housing 
complexes on all four sides, with just one path leading to the outside. After
