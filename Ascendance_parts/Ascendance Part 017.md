I could tell from his eyes that he had found something to make profit on, and 
given how all the older ladies pounced on the shampoo at Tuuli’s baptism, I 
could imagine that my simple all-in-one shampoo would be pretty valuable. 

“It’s a combination of common things, but the details are a secret.” 

“Boy, do you have the same stuff in your hair?” 

“Myne put it on me, saying I needed to look clean for this...” 

Ah... Mr. Benno. Did you just click your tongue? Did you take me lightly, 
thinking I would just tell you right away because I’m a kid? Too bad. Your 
interview with Lutz hasn’t even started yet. I won’t let go of a valuable card in 
my hand during this preliminary skirmish. Benno and I gave fake smiles to each 
other, sparks flying, until Otto let out a sigh and scratched his head. 

“So. You want to become a traveling merchant, Lutz?” The interview was 
finally beginning. I heard Lutz swallow hard next to me. You’ve been thinking 
about this since yesterday, right? Now’s your time to shine. Tell them your 
motivation and grab success! I stealthily squeezed Lutz’s hand, hoping to 
convey that I was supporting him from the side. 

“Ah. Right. I...” 

“Give it up.” He was stopped before he could even explain himself. At least 
let him tell you what he worked so hard to think up! I yelled on the inside as Otto 
looked down on Lutz with an uncomfortable, bitter look. “Only an idiot would 
give up their city citizenship.” 

“...Mr. Otto, what’s city citizenship?” I let a question slip out by accident. I 
had never heard that phrase before. I could imagine that it meant one’s right to 
be a citizen living in a city. But I didn’t know whether or not it was similar to 
Japanese citizenship, which was given to anyone born in Japan even if they 
didn’t know about it until they learned in school. 

“It’s the right to live in this city. At the same time, it’s proof of your identity. 
When you turn seven and get baptized in the temple, you get registered as a 
citizen of the city. Citizenship changes everything, whether it comes to getting a 
job, getting married, or renting a house. It costs a ridiculous amount of money 
for an outsider to get registered at the temple, obtain citizenship, and earn the 
right to live in the city proper.” 

“Mr. Otto, did you pay that money?” 

“Sure did.” Otto nodded with a frown, probably remembering what that was 
like. 

Benno grinned and pointed at Otto. “This guy dumped all his savings so he 
could marry Corinna.” 


“I wanted to have enough left over to buy a shop here, but it took all I had 
just to afford citizenship.” 

I had no idea how much money a traveling merchant would have saved up, 
but I got the feeling nothing would be enough to afford citizenship, marriage, 
and opening a store. 

“Plus, living in a city and living on the road are completely different. Listen, 
Lutz. Do you know what it’s like to live most of your life in a horse-drawn 
carriage?” 

“...No.” Lutz shook his head. It took at most two hours to walk from one side 
of the city to the other, so the kids of the city fundamentally walked everywhere. 
Lutz had probably never ridden in a carriage in his life, so he probably couldn’t 
imagine such a life. 

“Take water, for instance. What do you do if you need water?” 

“Draw it from the well.” 

“Right. But there aren’t any wells on the road. You gotta find your own 
sources of water.” 

“A river could...” Lutz immediately imagined using a river as a source of 
water, like the one in the forest. But it’s not like he would be traveling alongside 
a river the whole time. And given how expensive paper was, I couldn’t imagine 
that every traveling merchant had a good map. 

“When a traveling merchant first leaves town, they won’t know where the 
rivers are, Lutz. You won’t be traveling beside one the whole time, so...” I said. 

“Myne’s right. So usually, you always follow the same routes. You learn 
more as the years go on, you trade information, and you gradually get to know 
which roads are safe and where the usable sources of water are. You pass that 
information onto your kids and they inherit your routes. There’s no room for 
other people in the middle of the cramped carriage you live in. And now, the 
most important part: where traveling merchants end up. Do you know what 
traveling merchants want more than anything else?” 

Lutz fell silent and shook his head. 

“City citizenship.” 

“Wha?!” 

“They want to end their hard life on the road and live in a city someday. They 
want to own a store in a city and do business safely. That’s what they save up 
money for. That’s the dream of a traveling merchant. No traveling merchant will 
take a kid who already has a citizenship. If you want to go down this road in life, 
you gotta start on your own. There’s no apprentice system for traveling 


merchants.” 

If the dream of a traveling merchant was citizenship, then Otto had already 
achieved his dream. He didn’t get the store he apparently wanted, but still, I 
didn’t know why a merchant would have become a soldier. 

“Mr. Otto, why did you choose to become a soldier?” 

“Wait! Stop. Don’t ask tha — mgggh!” Benno started to say something, but 
Otto clamped a hand over his mouth and made a bold proclamation. 

“To marry Corinna.” 

“I-I want to know the details!” 

“Listen, girl, I don’t wanna hear them. He’ll never shut up once he gets 
going.” Benno hurriedly tried to stop me, but Otto’s eyes were already shining. 

“Indeed. It all began not long after I entered adulthood. I came to this city 
and fell in love with Corinna at first sight. It was like an arrow piercing my 
heart, or the heavens themselves shining down upon us. In either case, I could 
see nothing but Corinna. I knew in my heart she was the only one I would ever 
want to marry, and I immediately wooed her.” 

“...I didn’t expect you to be so passionate, Mr. Otto.” Apparently, even a 
calculating former merchant with pitch-black ideas hiding behind a warm smile 
could be driven wild with love. His brown eyes and dark brown hair gave him a 
composed and down-to-earth aura, so it was hard for me to imagine him getting 
passionate with love. 

“That’s just how wonderful Corinna is. Well, I launched a pretty impressive 
attack, but she turned me down at first. She’s a famous, skilled seamstress and 
wanted to preserve the working relationships she’d formed in the city. She told 
me she couldn’t live a life of traveling, as I remember.” 

It’s true that you need to value your regulars, and if she’s skilled, she 
probably makes enough money to have a satisfying life. I can ’t blame her for not 
throwing away her stable life to become a traveler. Not to mention that from her 
perspective, Otto coming out of nowhere and trying to flirt with her would look 
pretty suspicious. I could imagine her suspecting that he was trying to trick her. 

I nodded in interest as I listened, and Otto’s tales of love gradually escalated 
and heated up. He spoke louder with more force and began waving his arms 
around. 

“When Corinna told me she planned to marry a man from this city, I was so 
shocked it was like lightning had struck me. I couldn’t even imagine another 
man marrying Corinna, and after desperately thinking of a solution, I went 
straight to the temple and bought my citizenship.” 


“Wha? Hold on a second. Isn’t that a bit sudden?” I looked at Benno to see if 
Otto’s behavior was normal for this world, and saw him rubbing his temples with 
an exhausted expression. 

“...Yeah, even a kid would realize that. And that’s not all. The money Otto 
spent on citizenship here was the money he planned to spend on opening a store 
in the city where his parents bought their citizenship.” 

“Whaaa?!” The price of purchasing citizenship in a city was halved if your 
parents had citizenship in the city, and Otto had been planning on using the rest 
to open a shop, according to Benno. Using your life savings to have a chance 
with a girl you just met instead of opening a store wasn’t something a calculating 
merchant would do. It was something a rampaging bull with only their goal in 
sight would do. 

“I wanted to open a store in this city, but I didn’t have the money nor did I 
have the connections back then. I knew becoming a soldier would show Corinna 
that I was determined to abandon my life as a merchant and start a life here with 
her, so I asked your father, who I had gotten to know while passing through the 
gate, and he hired me as a soldier who would deal with their paperwork. Aaah... 
Thinking about it now, Corinna sure was surprised when I proposed to her after 
buying my citizenship and becoming a soldier.” 

Well I mean... Naturally. There’s not a young woman in the world who 
wouldn’t be surprised to see someone dump their life savings and change their 
life just to marry her. I want to ask Corinna her perspective. Did she say yes 
because she felt the need to keep Otto in control, or because her heart fluttered 
at the sheer intensity of his love for her? I feel like her story will be completely 
different from Otto’s. 

“I spent days wooing her, and eventually I married into her family, rather 
than her into mine. You have no idea how cute Corinna looked when she laughed 
and called me the most persistent man she’d ever met! And now...” 

Otto began talking at length about just how cute his wife was. He just 
wouldn’t stop. I wished he wouldn’t use the excellent communication skills he 
built up over years as merchant just to brag about his wife. I mean, Lutz was just 
sitting there, overwhelmed by the endless flood of bragging. I had heard that 
Otto was all about his wife, but I thought Dad was just exaggerating. He wasn’t. 

...What should I do? I didn’t think Otto was this kind of person. I looked to 
Benno for help, and after making eye contact, he gave a light shrug. He seemed 
used to this. 

“Otto, don’t forget why we’re here. Drop the wife talk and get back on 


topic.” 

“Ahem! Sorry. Anyway, that’s that. Give up on being a traveling merchant.” 

What do you mean, that’s that? I wanted to tease him a bit, but I swallowed 
the urge. He got pretty off topic, but we did learn that traveling merchants didn’t 
have an apprentice system, that being a traveling merchant is rough, that the 
citizenship we have is important, and that falling head over heels in love is too 
scary. 

Lutz, having been told to give up his dreams, hung his head to a depressing 
extent. He had thought hard about his motivations, but got rejected before he 
could even say them, then got the harsh reality of being a traveling merchant 
slammed into his face along with endless bragging. Anyone would get 
depressed. 

“...Lutz, this is something Myne suggested, by why don’t you try becoming a 
normal merchant apprentice? You’ll at least get to leave town to buy 
merchandise.” 

“Myne?!” Lutz’s head shot up and he looked at me. His eyes burning with 
anger made it clear he was thinking “You knew I wouldn’t be able to become a 
traveling merchant?” 

“I thought it would be better for you if you heard it directly from a former 
traveling merchant. You’ll believe Otto sooner than you’d believe me, right? 
Since we’ve grown up the same way.” 

“...Ah.” I must have been exactly right, given how Lutz looked away 
awkwardly. 

“I knew from Otto that being a traveling merchant would be hard, so I 
thought it might be better if you start a job that both lets you go outside the city 
and won’t get rejected by your family. Plus, I didn’t even know about this until 
now, but I don’t think you should take a job that would make you lose your city 
citizenship.” 

“...Yeah.” Otto’s speech had definitely given Lutz something to think about. 
Listening to Otto’s real life experience was definitely more influential to him 
than anything I could have said. 

“Dad told me that Mr. Otto had some connections with merchants of this city, 
so I was just asking him to introduce you to one of them if you ended up wanting 
that. You can turn him down if you want, Lutz.” 

“...Huh. You really thought this through.” Lutz let out a sigh and looked up a 
Benno. I looked at him too. If Lutz wanted to be an apprentice merchant, we 
would have to deal with Benno, not Otto. 


“And that’s why I’m here. You want to be a merchant, boy?” 

“Yes.” Lutz nodded, and Benno narrowed his red eyes. The casual 
atmosphere he had when listening to Otto brag about his wife was completely 
gone. He looked down at Lutz with the narrowed eyes of a predator who had 
found prey to conquer. 

“Hm. So, what do you have to sell? What would you want to sell as a 
merchant?” 

“Wha?” It was normal for interviewers to ask why the applicant wanted to 
work for them, but Lutz had been thinking of reasons why he wanted to become 
a traveling merchant. It wasn’t so easy for him to come up with a new reason for 
becoming a normal merchant on the spot. 

“I’m asking what you want to do as a merchant, and what you can do.” 

« J 55 

Gyaaah! This interview is way too intense for a six-year-old! I wanted to tell 
Benno to ease up a little, but for merchants, each apprentice involved a 
significant amount of time and money spent. He had no reason to take Lutz 
under his wing and take a loss over a connection as weak as “friend of Otto’s 
assistant.” If Lutz didn’t have something useful to Benno, like proper 
determination, motivation, or information about a product that would be worth 
money, it wouldn’t be surprising for him to get rejected immediately. Really, we 
should be grateful that he was willing to meet us at all. 

“If you don’t have an answer, we’re done here.” 

I could see Lutz lower his eyes a little and bite his lip in frustration. I didn’t 
know if what I was about to say would help Lutz or push him onto a road of 
unnecessary struggling. It would be up to him. 

I whispered quietly to Lutz such that only he could hear. “...Will you make 
my paper, Lutz?” 

“I will.” Lutz jerked his head up. He squeezed my hand tightly. I could feel it 
shaking, but Lutz was glaring at Benno with a ferocious expression. “Yeah, I 
have something I want to do! I want to make all the things that Myne thinks up!” 

“Uh huh. That’s what you’ve been doing for a long time.” 

“Myne ’ll push herself too far without me, so I’ll make the stuff for her.” 

Lutz... I’m proud of you. You said what you needed to say. Benno ’s looking 
really surprised right now. 


In the end, I didn’t know whether I pulled Lutz into this or if Lutz pulled me 
into this, but if Lutz was willing to do what I couldn’t, then I was willing to do 
what Lutz couldn’t. And unlike him, I had plenty of experience with job 
interviews. 

Still looking up at Benno, I smiled brightly. I took a deep breath, let it out, 
and began to speak. “I want to make and sell paper that isn’t made from animal 
skin. It’ll be cheaper to make than parchment, so I think it will be very 
profitable.” 

Hearing that, Benno grimaced. He looked at me with a far more intense glare 
than he had looked at Lutz with and spoke in a low, harsh voice. “...You want to 
be a merchant too, girl?” 

“Yes. It’s my second choice.” I nodded with a smile, and Otto blinked in 
confusion. 

“Is your first choice doing paperwork at the gate?” 

“No, I want to be a (librarian).” 

The three of them all looked confused. As expected, they hadn’t understood 
what I said. 

“...Never heard of that before.” 

“I want to work a job where I manage a large number of books.” 

After I explained what a librarian was in simple terms, Benno began 
laughing. “Pfff... Haha, sorry, but that’s a job only nobles get to do.” 

“...I knew it.” Curse you, nobles. I figured that if only nobles had books, then 
the librarians managing them would be nobles as well. Status-based 
discrimination ticked me off. 

“But wait. Paper that isn’t parchment, you say? Do you have some on hand?” 
He glanced at me, visibly on guard. I could guess that he was calculating the 
effects and potential profit that introducing paper other than parchment into the 
market would have. 

“Not yet.” 

“Then we’re done here.” 

He said we were done, but he was definitely interested. I could probably push 
him into a compromise in no time. I broadened my smile. “If you just want a 
real-life example, I can make one. Our baptism is summer of next year, so I’ll 
make prototypes of my paper by spring. You can decide then whether you can 
use them or not.” 

“...Alright.” Benno had intended to turn us down, but in the end I had 
managed to postpone his decision. A clear and splendid victory. 


“Thank you very much, Mr. Benno.” 

“I haven’t said yes yet.” 

“But still, you’ve given us a chance to try.” Now Lutz and I just had to do our 
best. His job and future were on the line here, so he would probably work hard. I 
couldn’t help but grin after realizing I now, out of nowhere, had a chance to 
finally get paper. 

“Let’s do our best, Lutz.” 

“Yeah.” 

“Mr. Otto, thank you very much for introducing us to Mr. Benno.” I 
expressed my gratitude to Otto, who was looking at us while grinning. Thanks to 
his efforts, Lutz had wisely given up on becoming a traveling merchant and 
made the first step toward becoming an apprentice merchant. That was the best 
possible result I had envisioned for this meeting. 

“This day off ended up pretty fun. I’m looking forward to the next time you 
drop by the gate.” 

“Me too.” It seemed that Otto gave us a passing grade too. I sighed in relief 
and, having noticed that Otto was subtly suggesting we end the meeting here, 
started walking off with Lutz. Ah... Wait. I forgot. 

“Um! I just remembered I have something I want to ask you two, Mr. Otto! 
Mr. Benno!” I stopped, turned around, and saw that Otto and Benno had likewise 
started walking off. They both turned around at the same time. 

“Yeah? What’s up?” said Otto. 

“Do either of you know of a disease where there’s like, heat inside of you that 
grows and shrinks rapidly?” Otto had traveled the world and Benno seemed like 
a guy with connections everywhere, so it was possible that one of them knew 
about the heat inside of me. “It feels like the heat is eating away at your very 
being, and if you desperately push it back, it shrinks. Sorry for the subjective 
explanation, but...” 

“No clue. I’ve never heard of anything like that.” Otto casually shrugged. 

I looked toward Benno. He briefly lowered his eyes, then slowly shook his 
head. “...Never heard of it.” 

If neither of them were familiar with it, then it was safe for me to assume that 
nobody in my sphere of interaction knew what it was. Apparently, I was sick 
with something fairly rare. 

“...Okay. Thank you.” 

Lutz and I resumed walking, holding hands. I didn’t learn anything new 
about my sickness, but I had won conditional employment and gained a helper 


for making paper. One step forward. 

“Let’s make paper together, Lutz.” 

“Yeah!” Lutz, having managed to forge ahead a path in life without his 
family’s help, gave me a smile filled with hope and excitement. 


Epilogue 


Otto returned home to his loving wife after the meeting with Myne and Lutz. 

“I’m home, Corinna. Just got back. Benno’s with me.” 

“Welcome home, Otto. I hope you kept a good eye on my brother. Though I 
can’t say I approve of you coming home with a smile after teasing those young 
pre-baptism kids.” 

“You look cute even when you’re pouting.” Otto wrapped his arms around 
his adorable wife’s hips and kissed her cream-colored hair repeatedly before 
heading to the parlor. Benno thumped him on the head and said, “Do that when 
I’m not around.” 

Otto, being as utterly devoted to his wife as he was, wanted to reply with 
“Don ’t interrupt our sweet time together, ” but if he said that in front of Corinna 
she’d probably get mad and say not to embarrass her in front of her brother, so 
he had to swallow it down. 

The parlor in Otto’s home was usually used as a room for Corinna to have 
meetings with her clients. The center of the room had a circular table, unlike the 
dining room, and it had four-legged chairs placed around it. The right side of the 
room had a shelf with samples of clothes she had sewn before. On the left wall 
hung tapestries that she had sewn with leftover cloth. 

“Maaan, I didn’t expect things to go like that at all. To think she’d force 
Benno into negotiation like that...” Otto, having sat in one of the chairs, grinned 
at the frowning Benno sitting across from him. 

“Oh? My brother, forced to negotiate? Please share the details with me, Otto 
dear.” Corinna’s gray eyes shined and she scooted her chair toward Otto a little 
as she asked for details with a sweet voice. It was rare for her to act so sweet, so 
while clapping enthusiastically in thanks for Myne on the inside, Otto casually 
told her what had happened. 

“...And just like that, Myne made the meeting a lot more interesting than I 
thought it would be.” 

“Myne is the daughter of your captain, isn’t she? The one you said was 
incredibly smart.” 

“Yep, that’s the one. But you know, it’s been about half a year since she 


became my assistant and I still don’t get her. She’s so abnormal I really have no 
idea what kinda parenting would make a kid like her.” 

Otto had met all sorts of people of various statuses across the world as a 
traveling merchant, so Myne’s abnormality stood out even more to him. The 
same went for Benno, who had accompanied him to meet her today. Benno knew 
people from all ranks of society thanks to the range of his work as a merchant. 
While Otto the former traveling merchant had a wide but shallow range of 
knowledge, Benno the rich city merchant had a deep and profound 
understanding of his city’s people. 

“Hey, Otto. Was that really the daughter of a soldier?” 

“Yep. Not a single doubt about it. But I’m with you in thinking that’s odd.” 

“What do you two mean?” Corinna tilted her head, curious. 

Otto thought of what made Myne seem weird and said what came to mind. 
“First, her looks. She’s way too clean to be a soldier’s daughter. Her clothes are 
the kind of raggedy hand-me-downs you’d expect, but her skin and hair are as 
clean as a whistle. The captain’s an older man like any other soldier, but neither 
of his daughters are dirty at all.” 

“Perhaps their mother just takes good care of them?” Corinna had been raised 
as the daughter of a wealthy merchant, and although she had seen poor people 
around the city, she didn’t have a good understanding of their lifestyle. It took 
time, money, and resources to take care of one’s skin and hair. She didn’t 
understand that those in poverty did not have the leeway to spare any of those. 

“Mmm, I saw her during the winter, and it didn’t look like their mother was 
putting that much effort into grooming. Though she and Myne do look alike. 
She’s a real beauty, totally wasted on the captain.” Myne had been told to wait at 
the gate during the winter once when the family went out to gather parues. Otto 
saw her mother when she came to get Myne, but didn’t get the impression that 
she was particularly more clean than average. 

“...Do you think Myne is odd as well, brother?”
