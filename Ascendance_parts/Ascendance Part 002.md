passing through the narrow, dark alleyway, we emerged onto a large road. 

Wow! This looks exactly like one of the old European cities I’ve seen photos 
of. An unfamiliar scene spread out before me, with carts pulled by horses and 
donkey-like creatures passing each other by on a wide cobblestone road dotted 
on either side by stores. I spun around, looking everywhere like a tourist in my 
quest to find a bookstore. 

“Mom, which store are we going to?” 

“What are you saying, Myne? We’re going to the market. We almost never go 
to any stores.” According to Mom, most of the stores near ground level sold 
products for relatively rich individuals and had little that poor commoners like us 
could buy. We bought the majority of our daily goods at an actual marketplace. 

Mmm, in other words, a bookstore is probably a ground floor store just like 
these? I looked around for a bookstore while Mom walked, and soon saw an 
especially large building that would serve as a solid landmark. It was made of 
white stone and, despite its simple design, there was a sort of majesty to it that 
made it stand out. 

“Um, is that a castle?” 

“No, that’s the temple. You’ll be going there to be baptized when you turn 
seven.” 

Aaaah... A temple. It sounds like religion is enforced here, which sucks. I’ll 
try to avoid that place as much as possible. 

My instincts and knowledge from my past life made me want to keep my 
distance from religion. But I didn’t know if this world would be too kind to an 
atheist, so I kept my mouth shut and looked at the walls surrounding the temple. 

“Mom, what are those walls?” 

“Those are castle ramparts. Inside is the castle where our lord lives, and the 
mansions where nobles live. Well, in the end, nothing behind those walls has 
much to do with you and me.” 

The tall stone walls looked more like the gate to a prison than grounds where 
royalty lived within a castle. Maybe it would look even more like a prison if the 
guards were ever on high alert and defending against something. The blank 
white walls continued on either side, and although it looked like they had been 
designed with imposing dignity in mind without any artistic flourishes, they 
didn’t quite feel like the brutish walls of a fortress. It felt like they had been built 
only for the purpose of separation, and would be defenseless if ever actually 
attacked. 

Mmm... They do look a little different from the European castles Eve seen in 


historical films and stuff. 

“Okay, Mom. What about those other walls?” 

“Those are the outer walls. They protect the city. You know Gunther works as 
a guard at the southern gate, don’t you?” 

I knew from Myne’s memories that Dad worked as a soldier, but I didn’t 
know that he guarded one of the gates to the city. 

Hm... There’s a castle where the lord of these lands lives, and there’s both 
outer and inner walls here. I guess it’s safe to consider this a capital city? It 
doesn’t seem like that big of a city, judging by the length of the walls and how 
many people are walking around. But I shouldn’t think on the scale of Tokyo or 
Yokohama anymore. 

It would be a huge city in comparison to the historical fortress cities I read 
about in my past life, but in this world where it’s normal to have green and blue 
hair, there were no guarantees that my Urano knowledge would remain accurate. 
It would be risky to settle on the idea of this being a large or small city before I 
learned more about the world. 

...Aaah, the size of a city will change what kind of bookstores it’ll have, but I 
don’t understand what makes a big city here! Is this city big?! Is it small?! Tell 
me, someone! 

“Myne, we need to hurry to the market. Everything good will get snapped up 
before we get there.” 

I looked around desperately in search of a bookstore on our way to the 
market, but most of the stores on either side of us just had simple drawings on 
their signboards. The signs were either wooden with the art painted on, or metal 
with the art engraved into them, but either way I didn’t see anything resembling 
letters. That was good for someone like me, who couldn’t read the letters 
anyway, but a cold chill was starting to run up my spine. 

...Wait. Um, I don’t think I’ve seen a single letter in this whole city. Is the 
literacy rate that low? Or does writing itself not exist in this world? The very 
idea made my blood run cold. I hadn’t even considered the possibility of a world 
without letters. Without letters, books couldn’t exist in the first place. 

We reached the market while I was still stunned. I lifted up my head at the 
cacophony of noises and saw a lively bunch of stands lined up next to each other 
with plenty of people passing through. It looked so much like a Japanese cultural 
festival that I felt a little nostalgic. I subconsciously smiled and, after peering 
into a nearby fruit stall, saw something that shocked me to the point of smacking 
my mom’s shoulder. 


“Mom, look! What’s that board?!” Aboard with some symbols written on it 
was stuck into a box with fruit in it. I couldn’t read them, but at the very least, 
that confirmed that this world had letters or numbers or something. I was so 
starved for letters that the mere sight of such symbols was enough to make my 
face flush with excitement. 

“Oh, that’s the price. It tells us how much we need to pay.” 

“Hey, Mom. What’s it say?” 

Mom looked surprised at how excited I was getting, but I didn’t care about 
that. I had her read out the numbers on each board I saw, and I could feel them 
start to connect with the letters I already knew. 

Okay, great! Keep it up, my precious synapses! 

“Okay, so this says thirty Lions?” After Mom had read out several numbers 
to me, I tried reading some numbers on my own while gauging her reaction. I 
must have been right, given how she turned her head around to look at me while 
blinking rapidly. 

“I’m really surprised you learned them that fast, Myne.” 

“Eheh.” There were ten distinct symbols for what seemed to be numbers, so I 
assumed operating with base-10 math would be fine. I’m really glad they don’t 
use base-2 or base-60. 1 should be able to do math no problem if I can just 
memorize all the symbols. 

...Oh wait, am I going down the child prodigy path here? At age ten I’ll be 
God’s gift to mankind and at age fifteen I’ll be a genius, but once I hit twenty I’ll 
just be a normal person. Oh well. 


Books: Unobtainable 


“Okay, we’re getting meat next. We need to buy lots of it and then salt or 
smoke it to make it last.” After buying some vegetables and fruits, Mom headed 
deeper into the market. The stands selling meat were apparently closer to the 
outer walls. 

“Why are we buying lots of it?” 

“We need to prepare for winter, don’t we? It’s late autumn, so all the farms 
are butchering most of their animals and leaving just enough to survive the 
winter. More meat is sold now than at any other time of the year. Plus, animals 
tend to pack on weight in preparation for hibernating. Tasty, fatty meat is a lot 
easier to get right now.” 

“...Umm, does that mean the market goes away during the winter?” 

“Isn’t that obvious? There’s hardly any crops you can farm in the winter. The 
snow’s terrible too, so barely any markets are held during the winter.” 

It was obvious now, but I hadn’t thought about that at all. Even in Japan, back 
in the time before home greenhouses became popular, fruits and vegetables were 
seasonal and would disappear from store shelves until they were put back on the 
market later. In an age before freezers and refrigerators made it possible to store 
food in a fresh state, people had to make non-perishable food in their own 
homes. So basically, in this world, it’s natural to buy and cure food. 

To be honest, I didn’t really see myself being that helpful with any of that. 

I’m really glad I was reincarnated as a little girl that won’t get yelled at for not 
being a help around the house. 

“...I-It stinks.” The foul air got worse the closer we got to the meat stands. I 
had to hold my nose to bear it, but Mom kept walking forward without batting an 
eye. I could hardly believe it. The smell was so bad not even holding my nose 
closed was enough; it snuck through my mouth and hit me so hard tears formed 
in my eyes, and yet she didn’t seem bothered at all. 

Has meat always smelled this bad? Ngggh, I’ve got a bad feeling about this. 

We reached the meat stands. Strips of bacon and ham were hanging from the 
top, plus completely recognizable animal corpses that had obviously just had 
their skin peeled off. Within the stands were dead animals hanging off hooks, 


being drained of blood, and beneath them were wide-eyed rabbits and birds. 

“HIGGYAAAAAAAAH!” I may have seen pictures of skinned animals 
before, but all the meat I ever saw in real life had always been pre-sliced and put 
in packs. The meat stands of this world were far too shocking for me. 
Goosebumps rose across my skin and tears dripped out of my eyes. I wanted to 
shut my eyes to block it all out, but my eyes remained locked open, as if I had 
forgotten how to close them. 

“Myne?! Myne!” Mom shook me a little and spanked my rear end. But a 
second later, I saw a pig squealing in fear as a butcher prepared to chop it up. A 
crowd of grinning people surrounded it, eagerly awaiting the moment of its 
death. 

“Ah!” I let out a small cry and, right before the pig’s last moments, passed 
out on my mother’s back. 

Something flowed into my mouth. It was a liquid that smelled so strongly of 
alcohol I wanted to gag. I didn’t want to drink it, and the unexpected liquid went 
into my windpipe. Coughing hard, I shot up while blinking rapidly. Cough! 
“Ngggh!” Cough, cough! 

Um, was that alcohol?! Who in the world would give an innocent little girl 
strong alcohol like that! What’ll you do if I get acute alcohol poisoning?! I 
opened my eyes wide and saw my mom, holding what looked like a wine bottle. 

“Myne, you’re awake? Thank goodness. The stimulant really did work.” 

Cough! “Mom...?” She was holding me with a really relieved look on her 
face, so I couldn’t just say it out loud, but allow me to rant a little on the inside. 

Stimulant or not, why the heck would you ever give a child alcohol that 
strong?! And I mean, a weak little girl that’s always sick and just recovered from 
a bad fever that nearly killed her, too! 

“Okay, Myne. Now that you’re awake, let’s go buy some meat.” 

“Bwuh?!” I shook my head on instinct. What I had just seen was already 
burned into my retinas. It was so horrible I’d probably have nightmares about it, 
and just thinking about it gave me goosebumps. I never wanted to go there again. 
“...Ummm, I still feel kinda sick. Can I stay here? You can go on ahead, Mom.” 

“What? But...” Mom furrowed her brows. 

I looked around and decided to ask the older lady managing the stand behind 
us for help. I needed somewhere to stay before Mom dragged me away. 

“Um, ma’am, can I please stay here for a little bit? I’ll be still and won’t get 
in your way.” 


“You sure are a polite little girl, aren’t you? Your mother bought some 
alcohol from me, so I don’t mind. Miss, go ahead and finish your shopping. You 
don’t want to pull your sick child around and make her pass out again, do you?” 
The alcohol-selling lady, who had seemingly sold mom that “stimulant,” cackled 
to herself and easily accepted my request. 

The middle-aged man running what looked like a pawn stand nearby looked 
at me sympathetically and gestured me over. “You can come stay behind my 
stand. Nobody will kidnap you back here.” 

I went behind his stand and sat on the ground without hesitation. The strong 
alcohol from before was stirring around in my body. It’d be dangerous for me to 
walk around in that state. 

“I’ll be right back. Myne, don’t go anywhere, okay?” As Mom hurried off to 
finish her shopping, I stayed sitting down and lazily stared at the wares of the 
two stands. This was apparently the season where she got new shipments of fruit 
wine, so customer after customer walked up to buy small barrels of it from her. 

On the other hand, not many people stopped by the pawn stand. Hm... I 
wonder what people even pawn in this world? I took a look at the wares 
surrounding me and I didn’t recognize what more than half of them were used 
for. 

I pointed at the stuff lined in front of me and asked the older man what one of 
them was. “Mister, what’s thiiis?” 

“You haven’t used one before? It’s something you use when weaving cloth. 
And this is a trap used for hunting.” The older man seemed a little bored from 
the lack of customers, so he gave me explanations for everything I pointed at. 

Almost everything considered normal for daily life in this city was something 
I didn’t recognize. Even when searching through Myne’s memories, I found that 
she hadn’t been familiar with any of them either, maybe due to a lack of interest. 

I looked at his line of products, letting out awed murmurs at their various 
purposes, and eventually reached the corner of his stand, where I found a thick 
and heavy stack of papers bound tightly — just like a book. 

The binding was masterfully done, with gold carvings pressed into each 
corner of the cover. It was about forty centimeters tall and looked exactly like 
something I would have seen in a glass case back in the libraries I used to go to. 

A book? Um, wait, isn’t that a book? The moment I realized the bound papers 
were actually a book, the world around me lit up in pink. My heart brightened 
and I felt as if the dark clouds that had surrounded me for days had finally been 
swept away. 


“M-Mister! What’s this? What is it?!” 

“Oh, that’s a book.” 

...Yes! I finally found one! Here’s a book! It’s just one, but it’s here! In the 
midst of my despairing over whether or not books even existed in this world, I 
had finally found one. I looked at the bound paper while trembling with emotion. 

It was a fairly large and heavy-looking book with rich decoration. I wouldn’t 
be able to carry it with my weak, sickly arms. Plus, it definitely looked 
expensive, and I knew for sure my mom wouldn’t buy it no matter how hard I 
begged. But if books existed at all, that meant for sure that there would be 
smaller, easier to carry books out there. 

I spun around and began interrogating the older man with clear desperation. 
“Mister, do you know where they sell books?” 

“What, like in a store? There aren’t any stores for books.” The older man 
looked at me, baffled at the mere idea. 

My excitement immediately plummeted. “...Um, why are there books, but not 
stores that sell them?” 

“You have to copy each book by hand to get a new one. They’re so 
expensive, there’s no market for them. Even that book is just something a noble 
pawned to pay back a debt, it’s not for sale. It’s looking like he won’t be paying 
me back in time, and although I’ll start selling it soon, only nobles will be 
interested, I’ll bet.” 

Grrr, friggin’ nobles! This means I could’ve read books too if I were reborn 
as a noble, right? Why’dyou make me a commoner, God? I felt a slightly 
murderous rage toward nobles. They were unfairly blessed to live surrounded by 
books from birth. 

“Is this your first time seeing a book, little girl?” 

I nodded over and over without looking away from the book. It was the first 
time I was seeing a book in this world, anyway. And since only nobles deal with 
books, plus the lack of bookstores, this might end up being the last time too. 
Which means! 

“M-Mister! I have a request!” I clenched my fists tightly and, after standing 
up straight, immediately knelt onto the ground. 

“Hrm? What’s this all of a sudden?” The older man opened his eyes wide in 
surprise as I grovelled on my hands and knees before him. It was just basic stuff 
that you need to show your sincerity when making a request. And the ultimate 
form of sincerity was pitiful grovelling. With my head held low, I told him my 
true feelings. 


“I know that I can’t afford this book, but please, at least let me touch it. I 
want to rub my cheeks against it. I want to sniff the book and inhale the scent of 
its ink before it’s taken away from me!” Despite my passionate request, the only 
thing that followed was painful silence. He wasn’t replying to me. 

I timidly rose my head bit by bit and saw that, for some reason, the older man 
had a shocked and disgusted look on his face, as if he was looking at an 
unbelievable pervert up close. Um... ? It kinda feels like my sincerity didn’t get 
across to him. 

“I-I don’t know what’s gotten into you... But I get the feeling I shouldn’t let 
you touch that book.” 

“N-No way!” I tried to ask him again, but before I could, my time limit ran 
out. 

“Myne, I’m back. Let’s go.” 

I nearly cried after hearing Mom’s voice. There was a book so close, but I 
hadn’t read it. I hadn’t touched it. I hadn’t even smelled its scent. 

“What’s wrong, Myne? Did he do something to you?!” 

“N-No, he didn’t!” I hurriedly shook my head after Mom suddenly glared at 
the older man. If I didn’t clear the misunderstanding up fast, I would be bringing 
trouble to the nice man who had sheltered me from the butcher and taught me 
about books. “My head feels weird. Mom, what did you make me drink? I’ve 
felt weird since waking up.” 

“...Aaah, the stimulant may have been a bit much for you. You’ll be fine if 
you drink some water and rest when we get home.” Mom nodded to herself, but 
didn’t seem to regret making her child drink alcohol. She took my hand and 
pulled to get me walking home. 

I twirled around to the two stand owners and smiled brightly. “Thank you for 
letting me stay here.” It’d be bad for my mental health if I didn’t thank them. 
According to Myne’s memories, it wasn’t customary to bow in this world, so I 
just settled for smiling and waving. Smiles were important in making human 
interactions successful. They saw me off with smiles on their faces too, so it 
must have worked. 

“Myne, do you still feel bad?” 

“...Mhm.” 

We talked little on the way home, me on Mom’s back again. I looked again 
along the way, but there really weren’t any bookstores. I had thought that I 
would beg for a child’s picture book and slowly learn letters, but the day ended 
without me getting anything. 


All I learned was that there weren’t any bookstores. I now lived in a city with 
a castle and magnificent stone gates, but it didn’t have a single bookstore. Since 
that man said that books weren’t really for selling, it was possible that this city 
wasn’t special. Maybe there were no bookstores in the whole world. 

This is awful. I loved books so much I could go days without eating as long 
as I could read, and now you’re telling me to live life without books, God? That’s 
just cruel. Even if I told my parents I wanted to become a noble in order to read 
books, they’d just treat me like a cute kid with big, silly dreams. 

I couldn’t tell them I didn’t want to be born in this family. But at the very 
least, I would have liked to be born in a family with enough wealth to fish 
through a fallen noble’s belongings and maybe get a book that way. My family’s 
circumstances are so awful that I’ve already been beaten down by them. I know I 
won ’t get a book no matter how hard I cry or how many tantrums I throw. With 
no bookstores, I have no way of getting books. 

...And what do I do if I can’t get them? Well, what choice do I have but to 
make them myself? When the going gets tough, the tough get going. I’ll get 
books no matter what! I won’t let life beat me! 


Lifestyle Overhaul 


If there aren’t any books, I’ll just have to make them myself. My mood 
brightened with optimism after I came to that conclusion. 

But unfortunately, there was no paper in my home. I had confirmed that while 
searching it for books. In short, I had to go buy paper, but I didn’t know where it 
was sold. And once again, there were unfortunately no convenience stores, 
department stores, supermarkets, or office supply stores in this city. 

So, where might paper be sold? Since the older man back at the pawn stand 
said that each book had to be copied by hand, it was possible that books with 
blank paper inside were sold somewhere. But where might that be? 

Maybe there was a store that only sold paper. If I were in Japan, I could bind 
sheets of loose-leaf paper, write in notebooks, staple together copier paper, or do 
any number of things to quickly make my own makeshift books, but things were 
not so easy in this world. There was simply no paper at all in my home, so to 
make books, I first had to begin a search for paper. 

We arrived home from the market as those thoughts spun through my mind, 
and coincidentally, Tuuli had just gotten back from the forest. Apparently, she 
had gone to get firewood, nuts, mushrooms, and various herbs to use for 
seasoning the meat. 

“Hey, Tuuli. What’d you get? Lemme see, lemme see.” I peered into the 
basket containing Tuuli ’s spoils and soon found one of the things I was looking 
for. She had gotten several of the avocado-like fruits I had found when searching 
the house earlier. I saw Mom crushing it for oil, so I knew for sure I’d be able to 
get fruit oil from it. “Wow! Can I have one of these?” 

Tuuli thought about my request for a second before saying, “You want a 
meryl? Okay, you can have a couple,” and giving me two of them. 

“Thank you, Tuuli!” I rubbed my cheek against the meryl while going into 
the storage room to grab a hammer. I can make shampoo with this! 

Excited, I brought the hammer down. Slam! The meryl exploded with a 
heavy squish, spraying juices all over both me and Tuuli, who had followed me 
to watch. 


“...Hey, Myne. Why’d you do that?” Tuuli, without even wiping the juices off 
her face, gave me a bright smile with cold eyes. 

I jerked a little in fear of her blatant anger. Uh oh, this isn’t good. Tuuli looks 
really, really mad. “U-Um, Tuuli. You see, ummm, well. I wanted oil, so...?” 

“That’s not how you get oil from fruit! What’s wrong with you?!” 

Geez... I can’t help that I don’t know the proper method. The Myne in my 
memories would always look away whenever Tuuli tried teaching her. 

Everything she’d said ended up so distorted I couldn’t understand it. Myne was 
apparently jealous to the point of frustration at Tuuli, who was healthy, energetic, 
and capable of doing everything she couldn’t. 

So many of Myne’s memories were buried in her thoughts of “no fair,” it 
made me kind of not like her. I mean, Tuuli’s such a nice older sister. She takes 
good care of me and teaches me what I did wrong even when she’s mad. 

I started to clean up the exploded meryl while Tuuli complained to me, but 
before I finished, Mom came back from the well and went red with anger after 
seeing what a mess the walls were. She doesn ’t care about the floor no matter 
how dirty it gets, but she cares this much about the walls? I later learned that 
nobody really cared about dirt or soot, but fruit juice would eat into the wood of 
the walls and hurt them, which was a big deal. 

After I finished cleaning, I looked between the crushed meryl, Mom, and 
Tuuli. I wanted oil as soon as possible, but I wasn’t sure if I should ask Mom or 
Tuuli for help. When in doubt, go for whoever ’s less angry. I stealthily 
whispered to Tuuli. “Tuuli, Tuuli. How do you get oil from the fruit? Will you 
teach me?” 

“Mom, can I teach Myne?” Despite my whispering, Tuuli just let out a loud 
sigh and called out to Mom. 

“Haaah. Who knows what she’ll do if you don’t teach her. Go ahead,” said 
Mom while pointing at the storage room. 

Really, I don’t think I can be blamed for messing up things I was never taught 
to do. If Myne’s memories were better, I wouldn’t make so many mistakes like 
this. 

I followed Tuuli into the storeroom so she could teach me. The tools for 
extracting oil were all in there. 

“The fruit’s juices and oil will seep into our table since it’s wood, so you 
can’t just crush it like that. You need to put this metal stand down first. Start by 
putting a cloth over it. Then wrap the fruit in the cloth. If you don’t, the oil will 
spray everywhere. But since most of a meryl can be eaten, we usually get oil 


from the core after eating the rest. I’ll teach you how to extract the oil after we 
get the seed out.”
