I had planned on staying single and enjoying life. A woman I know came back into my life, and being able to show up for her in small ways makes me so damn happy. She appreciates it when I bring her coffee. She appreciates that I&#x27;m consistent and calm. She has a 5-year-old autistic son, and I am able to handle his hyperactivity with calm. I work in an ER and I&#x27;m in nursing school, so stress is nothing new to me. I&#x27;ve been sober for 8 years. I&#x27;m rebuilding my life, and she tells me how proud she is of me for working so hard. Having someone that just likes when I&#x27;m around and likes the way I love is so refreshing. I go over and cook food for her and her son. We are both rebuilding and taking things slow. Counseling is helping. Life is hard. Life is short.

My coping mechanism wasn&#x27;t anger or drinking. I was home alone all afternoon, so I deep cleaned the house so she could leave me in a clean, tidy house. I got on my hands and knees and scrubbed the floors. There were flowers waiting when she got home. But nothing I did was enough because it wasn&#x27;t what I did that was the problem; it was that she wasn&#x27;t attracted to ME. She told me how much I spoiled her and how great of a nurse I was going to be, but that she was done trying to force herself to love me and she really just loved the way I treated her. I&#x27;m so thankful for her letting me go because I would have broken myself trying to make it work. I lost my whole family that day. My stepson is 17 and angry at the world already and has pulled away. Her family has been my family for 8+ years. I lost my whole world. But I refuse to be broken. Im not going to stop loving people the way I do just because some people dont want me.">3 ч назад                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </div>
